##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [metal groaning]

##### [electronic beeps]

Hmm. Aw, this is... this is tricky. I'm pretty sure the hermit crab sales meeting was a total disaster. Then again, I've only ever been in meetings with Trexel so how would I know what success looks like? Anyway, that would mean that Trexel was... in part right about the approach and that makes no sense at all.  Oh Board. Oh Board, Trexel, is that you? Trexel, what are you doing in the wall?  I-is that a hatch? Do you have a secret Trexel hatch?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Override detected. Vocals muted.

#### NUMBER 1

##### [muffled]

Out of my way!

#### NUMBER 48 [muffled]

Let me go first!

##### [hatch door swooshes open]

#### NUMBER 1 [cross]

I'm Number 1!

##### [slap at each other while both trying to get through the doorway at the same time]

#### NUMBER 1

Stop. Just push!

#### NUMBER 48

Seriously!

#### NUMBER 1

Just push!

##### [grunting slaps, pop as they make it through the doorway, brush off clothes]

#### NUMBER 1

No, David. We have a secret Standards hatch.

#### DAVID

Oh, no.

#### NUMBER 1

Number 48 and I felt it was time for us to have a little visit with you.

#### NUMBER 48

*You* felt it was time. *I* had a booking for us at the Executive Bistro. You *know* how hard it is to get a booth there.

#### NUMBER 1

Can we please not do this here?

#### NUMBER 48

You owe me is all I'm saying.

#### NUMBER 1

##### [pause]

Fine. Okay. May I please continue?  Thank you. Now David, you have been a subject of interest to us for some time.

#### DAVID

Of interest? Why am I of interest to you?

#### NUMBER 1 [interrupts]

And, it is only thanks to us that you and that troglodyte Geistman have moved up in the world. We have big plans for you David.

#### NUMBER 48

Oh, plans is it? Well in that case maybe I should add "plus one clone" to the next dinner reservation.

#### NUMBER 1

*Please*, can we just... not? Let's cut to the chase then David. You are part of a larger set of events. You don't need to know what. All you need to know is that we can offer you some protection.

#### DAVID

Oh, okay, well first, could you take me away from Trexel?

#### NUMBER 1

##### [David whimpers]

Still... talking!  But when we start looking into the files and find our progress blocked by IMOGEN, well, we start to ask ourselves if there isn't something else going on. Perhaps you and IMOGEN already have an arrangement of some kind.

#### DAVID

Well um, uh... No, no! No. No, I don't.

#### NUMBER 1

Whatever the case may be, our plans will move forward regardless. But our protection only stretches so far. And if you seem to be more of a liability than an asset then, well, I'm sure you don't need telling what will happen then.

#### DAVID

No.

#### NUMBER 1

Wonderful. Well I'm glad we understand each other. And would you look at the time. We might still make our booking.

#### NUMBER 48

Don't think you don't still owe me.

#### NUMBER 1

Oh, come now. We will barely miss the first floor show if we hurry.

##### [footsteps leaving]

#### DAVID

##### [yelling after them]

##### [hatch door swooshes and then clanks closed]

##### [whimpers]

Wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, no no no. No, we don't understand each other!  Oh, I don't understand at all.  Oh, no. Oh no! Why is everyone always threatening to kill me?! I'm just a nice clone baby!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Unmuted. I hate it when they do that.

##### [footsteps approach, door swooshes open]

#### DAVID

W-w-what--

#### TREXEL

Oh, David. Here he is, King [__DAVID:__ No-- wha--] David 7 [__DAVID:__ Uh--] up on his big king cloud. "Oh, I'm in charge. I'm David 7 and I'm in charge." So--

#### DAVID

##### [whimpers]

T-T-Trexel.

#### TREXEL

##### [David stutters]

What? What's wrong? You're all weird and pale, other than the regular weird paleness that you already had.

#### DAVID

S-S-Stand-- Standards.

#### TREXEL

What are you talking about?! What are you blabbering about, you fool?!

#### DAVID

Hole in the wall--

#### TREXEL

What hole in the wall?

#### DAVID

St-St-Standards came out.

#### TREXEL

What are you talk--

#### DAVID

Standards.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

Standards! [__TREXEL:__ You were--] Standards spoke to me.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Stellar Firma can neither confirm nor deny any secret hatches.

#### DAVID

They visited me in my little room.

#### TREXEL

You were visited by Standards?

#### DAVID

Y-yes.

#### TREXEL

Did they come through this door or did they come through a hatch in the wall?

#### DAVID

Hatch wall. Wall hatch.

#### TREXEL

That's their official route! Argh!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

What did I *just* say.

#### TREXEL

Why do you always get what I want?! Standards doesn't bother to meet me! Oh no, why would they bother with old Trexel Geistman? He's just a piece of trash that we can flush out of airlock!

#### DAVID

##### [stuttering]

St-St-Standards-- They-they, I think, I think--

#### TREXEL

You think you're better than me, don't you David?

#### DAVID

##### [stuttering]

I think-- I don't know, I think they've-- I think they threatened me.

#### TREXEL

Oh, they threatened you?! They never bothered to threaten me. [__DAVID:__ Wha--] At least not directly. I never got visited by them. Maybe a memo. On a good day, maybe a memo.

#### DAVID

B-b-but this was a bad thing. Yes, please take the Standards. Be threatened by them. I don't want--

#### TREXEL

No no no, no no no, don't, don't let me take anything from you, David. No, you've earned this. You've earned this attention from Standards *and I hope you're happy together*.

#### DAVID

No. No I'm not.

#### TREXEL

##### [resentful]

I hope you're happy with your new friend Standards, David.

#### DAVID

##### [exhausted sigh]

##### [sighs]

No. No no no, I'm not. And I, I don't, I don't think they're my friends.  Anyway, should we just--  Should we just do the-- Should we just do the brief?

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

Right, no, so, I don't know,  do you want to work out how to sell to, sell to somebody with Standards [__DAVID:__ I mean, no. No.] explaining things to you, David?

#### DAVID

No. No. And alright, it didn't... go as well... as maybe... it could have.

#### TREXEL

No, it didn't go well, David, did it?

#### DAVID

They just had so many--

#### TREXEL

What happened? What happened, David, [__DAVID:__ Well they just--] when we, we used your approach? [__DAVID:__ But they just had so many--] When we went to the client and we said, "why don't you just tell us what you want?"

#### DAVID

But t-t-they wanted so many things! A-a-and a lot of them didn't make-- a lot of them were mutually exclusive [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] and, and some of them were, s-some of them I don't think were actually physically possible. Um...

#### TREXEL

Nope. Absolutely not.

#### DAVID

B-b-but we just wrote them all down [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and, and then we sent them to the design consultants and--

#### TREXEL

And now what have we done, David? We've overpromised and what are we going to do, David? We're going to underdeliver. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] And how do you think that goes down with the client? How do you think that goes down with the client? And, and how do you think that's gonna go down with your precious Standards? [__DAVID:__ Ba-bad.] Do you think they're gonna be happy? [__DAVID:__ Ba-- no.] No. Remember--

#### DAVID

Ba-badly. Bad Gelp.

#### TREXEL

Underpromise and underdeliver. That's the Golden Rule. If people are already expecting disappointment when they get disappointment, they're going to be so-so.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

That is *not* the Golden Rule.

#### DAVID

C-couldn't we just did what we promised?

#### TREXEL

What happened last time we listened to you, David? [__DAVID:__ Um...] What happened? Did we come up with a good, a good brief sales? [__DAVID:__ N-n-no.] No. We came up with an unworkable mess. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Imagine if we received that when we were design consultants. Imagine if we received that page after page of mutually exclusive demands. What would we have done? What would I have done?

#### DAVID

Nothing differently to what you usually do.

#### TREXEL

No, because I'm a genius. But this is going to go to a less skilled person than I and they're probably going to try and follow it, the fools!

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

So, we're going to do what? We're going to follow Trexel's plan.

#### DAVID

##### [docile]

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Welcome to your new lesson: problem solving. When you've got a problem with a brief, you have to do problem solving. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And how do you solve problems?

#### DAVID

Uh, think carefully about them and--

#### TREXEL

You ignore them, David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

All the things the client said to you could have been solved with one quick fix. Click here, number 7 will surprise you!

#### DAVID

Okay! I'm just-- yeah.

#### TREXEL

Ignore the problem.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

It's not real if you don't acknowledge it or believe it's there.

#### DAVID

O-okay.

#### TREXEL

So, we're going to keep that in mind, David, for this whole session preparing for this next client.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Right.

#### TREXEL

So, what's the client brief?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um, so this is from Bee Frost, pronouns of we, us, and they. And they, they want a factory planet for building stars.

#### TREXEL

O...kay.

#### DAVID

Hmm. Uh, right. So their, their likes and dislikes is, uh, so they like the cold, barren void. It is comfortably vast and flawless. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Um, and they dislike fleshy creatures except as snacks.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Wow, that's, that's-- that's a big mood but okay.

#### DAVID

Um, if they were an animal, uh, what would they be? They would be a "human"--a-and that's in, that's in scare quotes--[__TREXEL:__ Okay.] um, for reasons.

#### TREXEL

Ominous. Okay.

#### DAVID

Their, their greatest strength is making cold honey because it's a fantastic fuel source.

#### TREXEL

Honey?

#### DAVID

Cold honey.

#### TREXEL

For a fuel source?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I've got to ask a bee about that.

#### DAVID

I mean, Bee Frost knows about it. Frosty Bees.

#### TREXEL

Oh, they're a Frost Bee! Oh, sorry, I, sorry-- I wasn't listening because you were talking and I-- Yes, it's a Frost Bee. Yes, the honey of the Frost Bee is one of the most potent fuels in all the planet. In fact, I think Stellar Firma is relatively concerned about them as a universe power because they control their own power supply. They don't, they don't need any generators from us. They can just cark out their own fuel.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Frost Bee honey is stupid. Hurray for Stellar Firma brand nuclear generators.

#### DAVID

Yeah, and they want to build stars. I-I think this might be a, a hive? 'Cause, um...

#### TREXEL

Are we talking to a collective here?

#### DAVID

They're plural pronouns, so... Their greatest weakness is, uh, pretty, shiny things. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Uh, "they are very distracting and have often stunted our advancement."

#### TREXEL

That's the only thing keeping them back.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You know, in the great universal game that Stellar Firma and many other groups play, like Bathin of Galactonium plays--you know, he plays it poorly, but he plays--and the Armoured Bears of Svalbard, and, and the Megatrons. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] The Bee Frosts are... well, yet another player on this stage.

#### DAVID

Right. And, and they've come to us for a, for a star building planet.

#### TREXEL

Yes. This is, this is tricky because we do need to respond to this because they have a lot of cash. And, as I mentioned, they literally produce fuel.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Stupid fuel.

#### TREXEL

That's useful. That's handy. You don't want to annoy *those* people. You know, let's mess around with the Megatrons, they're gonna try and blow something up. Guess what? You blew up something I made that looked like what we were, but was it? Ha ha ha. We win 'cause they're stupid. But when you've got a big set of bees that can make fuel, just don't get involved. [__DAVID:__ Right.] But they've come to us, David. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] They've come to us and what have they asked for? They've basically asked for Stellar Firma. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] And as we learned from last time, whilst that did deflect an attack from the Megatrons, if I do that again people are going to be really angry.

#### DAVID

Hartro might find three feet and put them in your mouth.

#### TREXEL

If not four!

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

So, how do we address it? Think of the lesson, David. How are we going to address this problem?

#### DAVID

'Kay, so we just need to solve this problem.

#### TREXEL

By...?

#### DAVID

Uh... Ignoring it?

#### TREXEL

We lost the brief in the mail. We go into the meeting [__DAVID:__ Oh.] and we say, "I'm sorry, I didn't know something was on today. And who are you?" [__DAVID:__ This--] And they'll be like, "oh, we're the Bee Frosts." And we'll be like, "oh, well, I'm sorry, we haven't got time for this meeting. It wasn't booked in. Can you come back in... never! Can you never come back?"

#### DAVID

No, but then they can't give us their money and they might withdraw their fuel.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David. We've already taken their details. You just withdraw it. What are they gonna do? Ask for it back?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Oh, they might ask for it back. Okay. So, we need to give them something to go away with.

#### DAVID

A-and no, so sorry, they do also-- remember they, they dislike fleshy creatures except as snacks, and I don't want to become a Bee snack.

#### TREXEL

Nobody wants to be a Bee snack. Now, I'm sure if we--

#### DAVID

So, we get them out of the room first.

#### TREXEL

--if we sacrificed ourselves for the greater cause of Stellar Firma, no one would be sad about that, other than you and I.

#### DAVID

##### [unconvincingly]

No, I would not be sad to sacrifice myself for the great cause of Stellar Firma.

#### TREXEL

But David, having said that, I personally don't particularly want to be eaten.

#### DAVID

Nor do I. I-if I'm given an option of, of various things, um, being eaten is, is not one of the ones I would pick probably.

#### TREXEL

So, how do we ignore this problem into solving-ship.

#### DAVID

Uh... we... technically fulfill the brief?

#### TREXEL

Oh, interesting. Interesting.

#### DAVID

So, they want something that builds stars. Now, I'm assuming they want a big star building factory to build actual stars.

#### TREXEL

Much like Stellar Firma's--

#### DAVID

Planets orbit around.

#### TREXEL

--building floor. Yes.

#### DAVID

Um, so, but maybe, we make them a factory that builds... model replica stars?

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Interesting. Now, you-you can actually engage in something that we call Fine Print.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's so small! Oh, it's not what we said in the room but it's what you signed. But the trick is, David, getting people to sign things without reading them.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

This is another problem ignorer. They're like, "oh, what's that at the bottom?" You'd be like,  "don't worry about it! Here's another glass of pure ethanol." [__DAVID:__ Right.] And then all of a sudden, they've blacked out and you've gone through their wallet.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Do not distill and serve your own ethanol to the client.

#### DAVID

Right, so, so, so basically what you're saying is, is we'll tell them that, yes of course we'll build a factory for stars. [__TREXEL:__ Absolutely.] And then it will say, "asterisk, asterisk, asterisk." And then down at the bottom [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] it will be like, "asterisk, asterisk, asterisk--"

#### TREXEL

And then, and then on the--

#### DAVID

"--stars may not be representative of this."

#### TREXEL

Not even there, David.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

It says, "asterisk asterisk, see appendix." [__DAVID:__ Right.] And then you look for the appendix and there's just a piece of paper that says, "please mail this address for appendix." You mail that address. It bounces back. Of course it does, because it's been spelt wrong on the form that you've got. You work it out because you're very, very dogged. And you get the right address. It goes through and it says, "this inbox is full. I'm very sorry." But then you find out who the manager is, because you're dogged and determined and you're going to get this right. You get into contact with them. You get a message saying, "I apologize, I'm on holiday... forever." So you find their assistant. And you email them, and guess what? You've died. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] It's taken so long that you've died of old age! [__DAVID:__ Right.] Nobody has to give you that appendix because guess what David? It doesn't exist.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right! A-and [__TREXEL:__ Doesn't exist.] potentially, by the time they've even found that, even if they are some sort of immortal superbee--

#### TREXEL

Then they'll still be bound by the Legalese.

#### DAVID

Yes, a-and also the warranty.

#### TREXEL

The Legalese are a species that we harnessed long ago. And they write the smallest fine print because they've got tiny little hands. "Ooh, tiny little hands to write the tiny little print! And we're going to hide it in our hives."

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, so, so, so to combat the hive of Frost Bees we have our own hive of Legalese--

#### TREXEL

Of Legalese.

#### DAVID

And, um--

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ Frost Bees and Legalese. Who will win? The Legalese will. ♫ That--

#### DAVID

I hope so, otherwise we're in--

#### TREXEL

That's a theme tune and you can keep it.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, I'm just gonna th--

#### TREXEL

In fact, can we workshop that into a holovid show: [__DAVID:__ No, I'm just--] *Legalese versus Frost Bees*.

#### DAVID

##### [drawer opens]

I'm, I'm just gonna take the theme tune [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] a-and for later I'm just gonna,  I'm gonna open this drawer. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, okay.] I'm just gonna pop the theme tune in that drawer--

#### TREXEL

In the drawer. Is there anything else in the drawer? Anything fun in there?

#### DAVID

Uh, no, not yet. Not yet.

#### TREXEL

No.

#### DAVID

That's the best idea that we've had in the drawer.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's going in the fun idea drawer.

#### DAVID

It's the, the good idea drawer.

#### TREXEL

Yeah!

#### DAVID

##### [drawer closes]

In the dr-- Close the door.

#### TREXEL

I never get things in the fun idea drawer.

#### DAVID

Well, there we go. And... we're back in the room.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Destroy the drawer.

#### DAVID

So, we can say to Bee Frost that, "oh yes, of course, we're going to, to make this planet [__TREXEL:__ Absolutely.] for you. [__TREXEL:__ Absolutely.] And it's, it's going to build (technically) stars." [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] Um, and, and that's, and that's all, all good.

#### TREXEL

That's all good.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

As long as they sign in the room, it's fine in the room. You can take that to the bank.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Idiom coined. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Remember David, if they sign in the room, it's fine in the room.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And then on go the sunglasses for dramatic effect. And then you immediately take them off because, not only are you indoors, you're in space and you're not a berk.

#### DAVID

Right. Uh, okay, so, so we've successfully solved the problem of the star factory.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Now we need to solve the problem of them enjoying fleshy creatures as snacks.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

This is an integral part of being a salesperson. When you're dealing with beings from all over the universe, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] some of them are going to eat you, David! You have to get this in your thick head! [__DAVID:__ Oh.]  ♪ Some of the clients want you dead. In the head, in the head. The clients will murder you if they can. Don't go off of the plan. If you learn these lessons three, you'll be fine and stay with me. Meeee-EEEE! Trexel who's alive. ♫ You see?

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

They sing that to children, David, [__DAVID:__ Okay] so I'd hope you'd understand!

#### DAVID

R-right. No, I-I do. I do understand. I understand and I don't, also don't want to get eaten.

#### TREXEL

Nobody wants to get eaten, David! Unless they're very specifically into that.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Vore detected. No judgement here.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, no, I'm not, I'm not gonna go down that route. Th-that's, that's for, that's a question for another time. But-- Okay. How do we not be eaten [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] by the Bee Frost?

#### TREXEL

Okay, so, you can't go in there and obviously not want to be eaten. You can't turn up with armour or weaponry. It sets a real weird vibe in the room. [__DAVID:__ Right.] I should know, I've been to plenty parties armed and *people do not like it*!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

So, you've got to present yourself as a willing supplicant, but always be light on your feet. You've got to learn the dodge.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Being a salesperson is as much a physical task as a mental one.

#### DAVID

Wait, s-s-so you're saying we're, we literally, we go in [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] and every time the Bee Frost tries to eat us--

#### TREXEL

It'll dart.

#### DAVID

We avoid them.

#### TREXEL

It'll dart, yes. You dart and dodge.

#### DAVID

So, so we jump out of the way.

#### TREXEL

You dart and you dodge.

#### DAVID

And that's it. We just--

#### TREXEL

And that's it.

#### DAVID

We just be faster than the Bees.

#### TREXEL

Well, you can also, you know, try and butter up the Bee. Not technically! Pour butter on a Bee and it will eat you. Because it's like, "ooh! Dinner time. Yum yum yum."

#### DAVID

Oh! Actually, no. What do Bees-- what does Bee Frost, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] what do they not like?

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

What do they not like?  What's in their, what's on their dislikes, David? What's on their dislikes?

#### DAVID

Uh, oh! Oh, their dislikes. They dislike... um... fleshy creatures except as snacks. Unfortunately, that one doesn't really help.

#### TREXEL

No no no no no! Think about it. Inedible fleshy creatures. We need to get into the room-- I have it, David! I have it!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Herd immunity. Have you ever heard of herd immunity, David?

#### DAVID

Uh... No, actually. Wh-wh-what is it?

#### TREXEL

Let me tell you about it. What you need to do is protect yourself in a herd of things. The Bee Frost, they don't know what humans look like. How many times do you think a Bee Frost has actually met a human? There's not that many of us in the grand scheme of things. [__DAVID:__ Probably just eat them.] So, what we do is we get a large collection of other fleshy creatures that are deadly poisonous. [__DAVID:__ Right.] They've got big stripes on them. They're weird colors. They pulsate in a certain way. And then we also paint ourselves weird stripey colors to denote natural poisonosity. And then we cover our mouths. "Who's talking? I can't see. Maybe I'll eat this fleshy creature. Oh no. It's an inedible one, and that's my weakness. Inedible fleshy creatures. I won't eat anything because anything could be a risk."

#### DAVID

Quick question.

#### TREXEL

Go ahead.

#### DAVID

Uh, what if they eat one of these poisonous creatures and die?

#### TREXEL

That's their own fault.

#### DAVID

And then they can't give us any money.

#### TREXEL [stammers]

David, I can extract money off a corpse like you wouldn't believe.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beeps]

Yikes!

#### DAVID

Okay. How about, maybe as a, as a potential, and I know it hasn't gone very well last time so I'm just gonna-- But they want to eat fleshy creatures as snacks.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So, snacks, when do you have snacks? You have snacks when you're bored and hungry.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

So... while we're talking to them, we keep them entertained by talking to them. That's good. We can do that, right? We're very--

#### TREXEL

I'm very entertaining, David.

#### DAVID

Yes, exactly. But we just keep them full. We fill them *all* up with other sorts of snacks, right?

#### TREXEL

Are you saying we sacrifice other creatures to them as we sell? I like that. That's sort of mythical. As we're telling them the things we're gonna do for them, we're pushing fleshy creature after fleshy creature towards them. Dumb, simple animals that they can feast on so that we, the higher sentient beings, may live and sell! They will die so we can enjoy the fruits of their corpse labor! [__DAVID:__ Uhhhh...] That's a plan, David. I'm gonna submit that as the David 7 Plan.

#### DAVID

Wait, no no no no, maybe--

#### TREXEL

When people do this in future, [__DAVID:__ No.] in future meetings when they're sacrificing [__DAVID:__ Ah, no but--] hundreds if not thousands of animals to the slaughter of commerce, they'll say, "I'm doing a real David 7 here" [__DAVID:__ Oh, no. Could we--] and they'll remember you.

#### DAVID

Could we make it the Trexel and David Plan?

#### TREXEL

No! I'm not taking any credit for this one, David.

#### DAVID

But you've got-- you've-- you could get credit for once. You, you-- maybe Standards will visit you.

#### TREXEL

Alright. Tell you what, we'll call it the Trexel Geistman Special. How's that as a compromise?

#### DAVID

Oh, oh you've twisted my arm.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

You see? Deals!

#### DAVID

Y-yes. Dealed.

#### TREXEL

You've been dealed!

#### DAVID

I-I've been dealt with.

#### TREXEL

Take the deal!

#### DAVID

##### [loud knocks begin]

##### [knocking stops]

I've-- I'm taking the deal. Here's the deal. Thank you very much. I've taken the deal. It's a Trexel Geistman Special.  So, shall we go and do a Trexel Geistman Special at the Bee Frost?

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

We've got to order up the animals, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, but the--

#### TREXEL

##### [beep]

IMOGEN?  We want a collection of animals. Please make them, mm, quite adorable. Big eyes staring at us hopefully saying, "Why? Why? Why?"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Generating adorable chattel.

#### DAVID

Was that... was that super necessary?

#### TREXEL

Well, I-I don't know what the Bee Frost like but I know when I'm eating an animal, I want it to ask why.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Well, off you go with the Trexel Geistman Special. You're, you're leading again. We'll see how--

#### TREXEL

##### [animal noises]

Oh, here they come.  Come on my lovelies. Come on.

#### DAVID

Oh, no. They are so adorable!

#### TREXEL

Oh, look at their little faces!

#### DAVID

Oh, I am.

#### TREXEL

David, help me corral them towards their doom.

#### DAVID

##### [sobbing]

This is terrible!

##### [large door opens]

#### TREXEL

##### [from meeting room]

Ah, Bee Frost! Guess what adorable snack I've got for you!

##### [David sobs]

#### VARIOUS ANIMALS

Why, David 7?
