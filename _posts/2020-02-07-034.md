##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [hyperventilating]

Right. Um... okay. Ethically dubious, morally wrong, but *not* killing David. Or standardizing David? I don't even know what Standards needs to do. I-I don't know what they do, do they just standardize things?

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Am I-- Ah! Ooh!

#### TREXEL

##### [getting increasingly frantic]

David David [__DAVID:__ Whuh. Uh.] David David David David David David. David.

#### DAVID

Trexel Trexel Trexel Trexel Trexel Trexel Trexel--

#### TREXEL

David! *David!*

#### DAVID

*Trexel!*

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Trexel!

#### TREXEL [suddenly calm]

Hello. How are you doing?

#### DAVID [shakily]

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

You look a little bit stressed, David.

#### DAVID [nervously]

Eeee. Eeee.

#### TREXEL

You did so *well* yesterday, David!

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### TREXEL

You did so well, I was proud of you in a way!

#### DAVID

G-g-oh, no!

#### TREXEL

As proud as somebody can be of a thing.

#### DAVID

##### [taking offence]

Uhhh.. whuh... oh. Oh!

#### TREXEL

No! Sorry, I-- That was harsh.

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

You're a cherished thing, David.

#### DAVID

I, uh, that's, uh...

#### TREXEL

A thing I hold close to me, like a brooch given to me by a maiden aunt.

#### DAVID [under his breath]

Or Percy.

#### TREXEL

What? Who?! What's that?!

#### DAVID

What? Who?! No! Uh. Over there! Ah!

#### TREXEL

Oh! Th-There's something in the corner! [__DAVID:__ Oh, it's the--] I've got it! I've got--aw. It was a shadow.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

But I nearly got it.

#### DAVID

Well I, yes, well, I thought it was...

#### TREXEL

But I've been thinking, David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [breathy chuckle]

You, you've, you've done [__DAVID: [wistfully]__ Terrible things.] very well [__DAVID:__ Oh, yes.] over the past few sessions. You-You've really started to, to really grasp what it is to be... to be a salesperson, and I think I'm seeing --as much as I hate to say it, David--real improvement in your work. So... [__DAVID: [flatly]__ Right.] I suppose I... I should maybe be a little bit less...... harsh... with you.

#### DAVID [hesitantly]

Riiight?

#### TREXEL [screaming angrily]

##### [suddenly calm]

Now, I don't want you to think that means I'm going soft, David. I'm not! I'm *not* going soft! In fact, I'm going to be like sandpaper, grinding away at your face! But, you must remember, that it's because I care...

#### DAVID [flatly]

Caring sandpaper.

#### TREXEL [screaming again]

##### [suddenly calm]

...about making myself the most glorious consultant ever to have lived! But you have to remember that behind that, David, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] is ambition.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

And behind that, David, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] is fear... [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] of... [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] the past.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

But in front of that... [__DAVID:__ Is...] is a big pile of velvet!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

That I sleep on at night.

#### DAVID

Okay. You sleep on top of... your... fears?

#### TREXEL

I *had* a bed, and I set it a little bit on fire... because there was a flood. So, [__DAVID:__ No, wait. No, hang on, what?] I just, I just found some curtains, and they were velvety, and I tore them down, and I sleep on those.

#### DAVID

Right. And the... the bed is your fear?

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

The-- the bed is your fear?

#### TREXEL

There's no metaphor here, David!

#### DAVID

You've just lit--

#### TREXEL

Just a big bed made of curtains.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Because I burnt the flooded older one.

#### DAVID

Yes. I'm... not... But it's wet... Whatever. Okay. Anyway, there is a brief to do.

#### TREXEL

There is!

#### DAVID

So should we do a brief? Wh-what's the lesson, Trexel? Wh-Wh-What *wonderful* thing are you going to teach me today?

#### TREXEL

Well, David. This is one of the more... extreme lessons that you have to...

#### DAVID

Really? This is the *more* extreme one?

#### TREXEL

This is a more extreme lesson, David, because this is about... emotional leverage.

#### DAVID

Aren't they *all* about emotional leverage?

#### TREXEL

In a way, but this one is one-hundred percent about emotional leverage.

#### DAVID

And yesterday's lesson *wasn't* one-hundred percent?

#### TREXEL

Oh! No! Yesterday's lesson was about confidence! About how you... I... are... am...

#### DAVID

Yes, "am."

#### TREXEL

...never ever wrong.

#### DAVID [overlapping trexel]

Never awr--ever wrong, right.

#### TREXEL

And you dealt with that beautifully!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And that person crumbled like a duck!

#### DAVID

Okay, so, what is this "a hundred percent emotional leverage" extreme lesson that we're going to be learning today?

#### TREXEL

When you are dealing with a client that has not been tractable with any of the other methods we've learned so far...

#### DAVID

Right?

#### TREXEL

...you tell them that you're dying and that this is your dying wish. It works every time, David. Nobody can deny a dying person! They're *dying!* ...... Yeah?!

#### DAVID

Okay, so, we're both going to be dying?

#### TREXEL

We're *all* dying! Now, [__DAVID:__ That's true.] the beautiful thing about this, David. The beautiful thing--because you got really hung up on the ethics last time--the beautiful thing is: we* are* all dying!

#### DAVID

So it's *technically* true.

#### TREXEL

--*technically* true. And a technical truth is the best kind of truth! Because it has all the legal definition of truth with none of the moral complications of truth!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Yes, fine. Yes, this is our dying wish.

#### TREXEL

So, we're going to find ways in which we can apply that lesson [__DAVID:__ Okay.] to this particular issue.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, let's, let's check the brief and *hopefully* it's got some really strong death themes, eh? Maybe they want a death planet for their death dogs where they put all their dead pets.

#### TREXEL

David, just because I think you're doing well doesn't mean I'm going to accept this level of *sass*.

#### DAVID

Okay, fine.

#### TREXEL

I'm still in charge!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

I'm still in-- I'm still a charge boy!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I'm fully charged up like a battery of confidence!

#### DAVID

##### [under breath]

##### [normal]

From a David. Right. Anyway, shall I get the brief out?

#### TREXEL

Go on.

#### DAVID

Master. Sir.

#### TREXEL

Servant.

#### DAVID

Ungh!

#### TREXEL

Gooh!

#### DAVID

Ungh!

#### TREXEL

Ungh!

#### DAVID

Ungh!

#### TREXEL

You're gonna crumble like a duck.

#### DAVID

Wah. Wah. Wah. What, no. No! I'm not a duck! You're a duck. No, I'm reading the brief.

#### TREXEL

Am I a duck?

#### DAVID

No! You're not a duck!

#### TREXEL

I'm a duck.

#### DAVID

You're a consultant called Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

I must eat bread!

#### DAVID

There isn't any bread!

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, look, brief time now, okay?

#### TREXEL

Yep.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Right so, who are you? Stefan--

#### TREXEL

I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

No, okay so--

#### TREXEL

Sorry.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Bickering tangents reaching critical levels. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Speaking as, as the brief--

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

Oh, sorry.

#### DAVID

--asking the client--

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

What an amusing mix up. *I'm* Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

No, who are--

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

Oh, sorry. No, sorry. I see what's happened. There's been a, a silly, a silly mix up.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

A silly mix up.

#### DAVID

Yes, so, so--

#### TREXEL

I'm Trexel Geistman. How are you?

#### DAVID

Um, I'm David 7 and I'm fine, and I'm reading the brief?

#### TREXEL

Oh, excellent!

#### DAVID

Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

Because I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

##### [quickly]

Okay... So the brief says... who are you? And the brief answers ba--

#### TREXEL

I-- I am--

#### DAVID

And the brief answers back...

#### TREXEL

Right. You interrupted me. I don't like that.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, I'm gonna start again.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Start again. Start again. Start again.

#### DAVID

So, the brief says the word--

#### TREXEL

I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

No, so the brief says the words... who... Right?

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Not, not addressed to us.

#### TREXEL

Nope.

#### DAVID

It's addressed to the client.

#### TREXEL

Third person.

#### DAVID

...are...

#### TREXEL

Yep.

#### DAVID

Yes....

#### TREXEL

...Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

No, so... So, the brief asks--

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

--these three words--

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

--in no particular order--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

...are...

#### TREXEL

Yep.

#### DAVID

...you...

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

...who?

#### TREXEL

No, I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Ri-- Wait. So the-- It's Stefan the Mantis Shrimp.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. I-- Yes. Okay, fine.

#### DAVID

Right. A-a-and their preferred pronouns [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] are he/him.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Stefan the Mantis Shrimp's pronouns are he/him.

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

It's okay. You can, you can just read the brief, David. You don't need to be so careful about all this. You're in good hands 'cause I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

Right, so, so, so why do you want the planet?

#### TREXEL

##### [interrupts]

I don't want a planet built. I-- It's not my request.

##### [long beat]

#### DAVID

Uh... S-s... No, so...

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

To be fair, it is unlikely to make a difference.

#### DAVID

So why does *he* want the planet built?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

Oh, sorry. Sorry, there seems to have been a, a s-- Oh. D-David, you'll, you'll not believe the mix up that's happened here.

#### DAVID

Do you know, I think--

#### TREXEL

I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Right, no, yes. Okay, so, so, so "why does Stefan the Mantis Shrimp want a planet built?" Right, so Stefan the Mantis Shrimp, *Stefan the Mantis Shrimp*--

#### TREXEL

Stefan the Mantis--

#### DAVID

--The Mantis Shrimp called Stefan--

#### TREXEL

There's a Mantis Shrimp called Stefan?

#### DAVID

--wants to celebrate his 10,000th birthday.

#### TREXEL

That's so old!

#### DAVID

He's now the oldest Mantis Shrimp in the universe!

#### TREXEL

That's the oldest!

#### DAVID

Huzzah!

#### TREXEL

Huzzah!

#### DAVID

It says huzzah!

#### TREXEL

Huzzaaaah!

#### DAVID

He's quite a cheerful Mantis Shrimp.

#### TREXEL

Mantis Shrimps are, despite their violent demeanor, a Mantis Shrimp, one of the more cheerful beings you'll meet in the universe.

#### DAVID

H-huzzah, I suppose. So, Stefan the Mantis Shrimp's likes and dislikes.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So likes: the ocean, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] long walks along the beach at sunset, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] stars, rainbows, colourful objects that also emit light arranged in logical order, soft sand to burrow into at the end of a long day. Right.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Dislikes: being exposed to the scrutiny of my peers--

#### TREXEL

Nobody likes that.

#### DAVID

Oh. Okay. Candles, barracudas, marine biologists, and grey.

#### TREXEL

Oo, grey. Okay. Okay. Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, "if you're an animal, what would you be?"

#### TREXEL

I'd be a Trexel Geistman galloping across the plains! Fear his claws!

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

I'm more of a scavenger, really, but I've got the claws.

#### DAVID

No, so *Stefan the Mantis Shrimp*, if Stefan the Mantis Shrimp were an animal, Stefan the Mantis Shrimp would be a... Mantis Shrimp.

#### TREXEL

Oh, that's, that's boring.

#### DAVID

Or a lion!

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. Or a lion.

#### DAVID

They're very much the Mantis Shrimp of the land. Or we're the kings of the ocean. Whichever. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Right. Uh, so what is Stefan the Mantis Shrimp's greatest strength?

#### TREXEL

Punching at the speed of sound!

#### DAVID

Surprisingly, no.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

"I can--"

#### TREXEL

I've always thought of that as a Mantis Shrimp's strongest power. That and its emotional distance!

#### DAVID

N-nope. Wrong again.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

Well, not-- according to Stefan, "I can detect 12 different wavelengths of light unlike pathetic humans and other petty species"--this has got very rude, very quickly--

#### TREXEL

Very rude, very rude.

#### DAVID

--"which only see in 3 wavelengths of light, so I have access to all the Hidden Colours of the Universe" which I didn't know were a thing. But "Hidden", "Colours", and "Universe" were all capitalized so I'm assuming this is a thing that only Mantis Shrimps know--

#### TREXEL

The HCU!

#### DAVID

--and now I want to know, I want to know what the Hidden Colours of the Universe are!

#### TREXEL

We all want to know what the HCU is!

#### DAVID

I am bored! I am bored of only seeing in 3 wavelengths of light. Stefan is completely right. I wanna see in 12 wavelengths of light, and I want to see the Hidden Colours of the Universe. It's not fair!

#### TREXEL

It's not fair!

#### DAVID

It's not fair!

#### TREXEL

I want *x*-rays! I want x-*rays*!

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Yes. Anyway, let's find out Stefan's weakness so we can kill them and take their eye-- No, wait. Hang on a minute.

#### TREXEL

Woah. Wow, David. David.

#### DAVID

Sorry, I'm just gonna-- whoop.

#### TREXEL

No no no. You've become, you've become an ardent globe thief!

#### DAVID

##### [defensive]

No. You're a... thief of..

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Visible wavelengths greed detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

No no no no. I've, I've heard it come out now. All of a sudden, [__DAVID:__ No.] you are covetous of their wavelength-seeing globes.

#### DAVID

No, I'm not.

#### TREXEL

And I like this colour on you, David. [__DAVID:__ No.] Colour me violent.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Caution: globe thievery will *not* be tolerated.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

No, it's-- Moving swiftly on. What is your greatest weakness? "I'm really tasty served with a variety of sauces."

#### TREXEL

And that has served the Mantis Shrimp very poorly over the eons. So long lived. So violent and powerful, but yum.

#### DAVID

Hmm. So, we have a 10,000 year old [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] very happy, [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] very tasty [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] Mantis Shrimp that likes walking around in the ocean and burrowing into things at the end of a long day. And, um... and they can see very well in many different... Yes. So, so we're gonna tell them that this is their dying wish or...?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

No no no no. David, David, David, David, David, David, David, David. David, you *ignorant fool*.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

It's *my* dying wish. "Hello, Stefan."

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Let's roleplay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

I'm Stefan the Mantis Shrimp. Huzzah!

#### TREXEL

Hello, Stefan the Mantis Shrimp.

#### DAVID

Hello Trexel Geistman that I've only just met. Huzzah!

#### TREXEL

How are you?

#### DAVID

I'm great. I'm gonna--

#### TREXEL

Well, I just have to let you know that I'm dying.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

And my dying wish is that you purchase *everything* from me.

#### DAVID

Everything?

#### TREXEL

Everything. Don't think about it. I'm dying, Stefan.

#### DAVID

Even your obvious toupee?

#### TREXEL

##### [coughs]

Even the toupee, Stefan.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

Pull it off my head.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Pull it off my dying head.

#### DAVID

Okay. Here I go, Stefan the Mantis Shrimp. Whoop!

##### [toupee rips off]

#### TREXEL

Wh-what?! I didn't think my hair was a wig!

#### DAVID

I just thought that was a bad haircut!

#### TREXEL

So did I!

#### DAVID

Uh, have it back!

#### TREXEL

Put it back! Put it back!

#### DAVID

Have it back! Have it back!

#### TREXEL

##### [rapid breathing]

I don't like learning things about myself in such an alarming way.

#### DAVID

Um--

#### TREXEL

I must have had hair at some point, and I must have replaced it with a wig at another point. But I have *no* memory of those two things converging.

#### DAVID

Uh, Stefan the Mantis Shrimp. Huzzah!

#### TREXEL

Ah, you see? So, even as a mantis shrimp--

#### DAVID

Oh no, I haven't bought anything from you yet. I've just nicked your wig.

#### TREXEL

That's true. Ok, uh-- Stefan.

#### DAVID

Yes. Huzzaaaaah!

#### TREXEL

I wish for you to transfer all your credits to me.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

##### [coughs]

But I'm dying, Stefan, and this is my dying wish. Would you deny me my dying wish?

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel coughs]

Well, Trexel Geistman, I *do* like living, but I've only just met you and still need to have things to live with myself.

#### TREXEL

##### [coughs]

And you won't have time to know me, Stefan, because this is my dying wish.

#### DAVID

Well, sucks to be you, nerd, because I'm seeing in 12 different wavelengths. I'm Stefan the Mantis Shrimp. Huzzah!

#### TREXEL

Aw, right. End, end roleplay. End roleplay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

You were really cocky as that Mantis Shrimp. You can't just tell me that my lessons don't work.

#### DAVID

Well, no, but... I mean, I'm being Stefan the Mantis Shrimp.

#### TREXEL

Oh, oh, I see. I see. Now all of a sudden you know so much about Stefan the Mantis Shrimp that, during a roleplay, Trexel Geistman's lessons don't work. Lesson six: emotional leverage, telling them that you're dying and this is your dying wish, doesn't work anymore because David 7's a convincing Mantis Shrimp.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Look. Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [voice cracking]

It *has* to work, David, because I thought of it!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

That is not a good way to judge things.

#### DAVID

No, but, look. Here's the thing. Here's the thing, okay? I was basically very method... and I was thinking, "what would Stefan the Mantis Shrimp think?" And I came in completely cold. I didn't know you. I don't know Trexel Geistman. I don't know anything about Trexel Geistman. He hasn't let me in. He's just walked through a door, told me he's dying, and told me to give him all my money.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Well, I, I suppose that's a good point, You need, you need to have-- you need to dig a hole in order to put the posts and pegs down [__DAVID:__ Yes.] in order to gain the fulcrum on which the emotional leverage will sit.

#### DAVID

Yes. You can't just come in completely cold. It, it slid off me like water off of a quacking duck.

#### TREXEL

Not a crumbling duck.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

A happy, quacking duck.

#### DAVID

Yes, a very, a very *alive*, a very alive 10,000-year-old quacking duck that's the oldest duck in the universe. Huzzah.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Beware the eternal duck. Their ancient wisdom is a ploy for bread.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well let's... let's run it again and I'll... I'll open up and we'll, we'll see.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

I'm Stefan the Mantis Shrimp. Huzzaaaaaah!

#### TREXEL

##### [somber]

Hello, Stefan. How are you?

#### DAVID

Hello, Trexel Geistman. I'd like to purchase a planet, please.

#### TREXEL

Before you do, Stefan, I'd like to tell you a story.

#### DAVID

Oh, would you?

#### TREXEL

It's a story about a young boy.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Barely... barely out of the nursery.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

His parents, powerful people. Powerful, powerful people but distant people. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] They've got busy jobs. They're busy people. They can't be expected to be to take care of a one year old! Screaming and, and defecating. So, they, they put him in, into care. Good, good people, I'm sure, but not... not them.

#### DAVID

Okay, uh--

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

But he meets someone. He meets someone one day. I suppose you'd call them a, a clone. He's still young now, of course, you understand, but, but he meets a clone and that clone becomes, becomes his friend. The clone's only there to take care of him. It's a functional clone but, [__DAVID:__ Um...] but the young boy sees something in that clone. A... a friendship, a camaraderie. In, in many ways they're both in the same situation. Coming from different angles, yes, but, but the same nevertheless. Both trapped by circumstance. Both limited and underappreciated. [__DAVID:__ Wait, Trexel. Wait.] And then one time, one time... his parents come home early, and they see him talking and laughing with a clone. A clone! And that's not *right!* [__DAVID:__ IMOGEN, stop the roleplay.] That's below the station of a Geistman! [__DAVID:__ IMOGEN, stop the roleplay!] "Take the clone away! Take them away and stick the boy in school!"

#### DAVID

IMOGEN!

Roleplay holovision terminated.

__[electronic powering off sound]__

#### TREXEL

##### [shaky breath]

"So he can learn to be proper." And so that boy closed up. So Stefan, do you want to buy a planet?!

#### DAVID

Uhhh... I--

#### TREXEL

##### [thump]

Because I'm dying! And this is my dying wish.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel starts crying]

So, um, Trexel, I just-- I did stop the roleplay because you've fallen off your chair. And, um--

#### TREXEL

##### [quiet]

Are you buying from me?

#### DAVID

No, wait, hang-- now, hang on a minute, I've stopped the--

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Are you buying from me, David?!

#### DAVID

What? No, I'm not buying anything from you.

#### TREXEL

Buy from me, please!

#### DAVID

Tr-Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Please buy something from me, David.

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Buy my sh--

#### DAVID

Stop grabbing at me!

#### TREXEL

Buy my things!

#### DAVID

Trexel, I have-- you don't have anything I want! I don't have any money! I'm a clone!

#### TREXEL

##### [crying]

##### [sobbing]

You're a clone. Just like they were.

#### DAVID

Like who was?

#### TREXEL

##### [sobs]

PERCY!

#### DAVID

What, your graph friend?

#### TREXEL

##### [sobs continue]

No, the-- Percy the clone.

#### DAVID

Did you name-- Did you have a clone when you were younger?

#### TREXEL

##### [quietly]

Yes.

#### DAVID

And it got taken away?

#### TREXEL

Yes...

#### DAVID

And recycled?

#### TREXEL

I don't know.

#### DAVID

So, why are you so careless with us now?!

#### TREXEL

I got too close. I got too involved, so I, I just-- I just thought, "well, maybe if I don't care, then it won't hurt."

#### DAVID

Won't hurt *you*.

#### TREXEL

Well, it didn't help Percy, did it?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Your parents did--

#### TREXEL

He wasn't "up to standards".

#### DAVID

Right, so your parents took away your childhood friend and so you've decided to take it out on every single other clone you've ever met.

#### TREXEL

You've about got it there, David.

#### DAVID

Despite the fact that they *die* when you do this!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Oh, snap.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So, what you're telling me is that your behavior towards clones is not just ignorance, but it's on purpose! You're telling me that everything you've done to get clones recycled has been on purpose and knowing! What you're telling me is that you've basically murdered--

#### TREXEL

Woah.

#### DAVID

About how many clones have you murdered, Trexel?!

#### TREXEL

Hey, now.

#### DAVID

How many clones have you murdered because you lost a friend when you were a "poor, little child" [__TREXEL:__ This--] with your "poor, little big house" [__TREXEL:__ Wh--] and your "poor, little rich parents", eh?

#### TREXEL

It's willful negligence at worst!

#### DAVID

Your parents or you?

#### TREXEL

Both of them!

#### DAVID

Right, do you like your parents?

#### TREXEL

No!

#### DAVID

Right, well, I don't like you!

#### TREXEL

Good!

#### DAVID

Fine!

#### TREXEL

Good!

#### DAVID

Still continuing to be fine!

#### TREXEL

I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

I'm David 7. What's your point?!

#### TREXEL

I don't know!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

This took a real turn.

#### TREXEL

But... we have to get through this, David, because... we're running out of time, so.

#### DAVID

Well, I'm getting through everything all the time! So, this is basically fine. This is basically par for the course, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Fine. Fine. Okay. Fine. Fine.

#### DAVID

##### [three loud knocks]

But yeah, sure, use your sad story on Stefan the Mantis Shrimp, huzzah! Okay, and we'll see how much Stefan the Mantis Shrimp--

__DAVID and TREXEL:__ Huzzah!

#### DAVID

--likes it. Right. We're gonna go in there and you're gonna tell your *stupid* dying story about your *stupid* clone and your *stupid* heartache... Honestly, who do you think you are?

#### TREXEL

Oh, I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

##### [large door opens, mantis shrimp sounds] [from meeting room]

Urgh! No! Right, we're going now. Right. Hello, Stefan the Mantis Shrimp. I'm Trexel Geist-- I'm David 7!
