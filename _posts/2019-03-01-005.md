Hi everyone, Alex here. I'd just like to take a moment to thank some of our patrons: stickyshoelaces, RJ, sarah randlett, Iryka Smeke, Mupod, Richard Dixon, Sarah Hickey, Jess Em, joseph fink, jane dataghosts. Thank you all. We really appreciate your support. If you'd like to join them, go to www.patreon.com/rustyquill and take a look at our rewards.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

Right. Um... Okay. Shift's almost over. No Trexel. No brief, either, the light's still off.

##### [footsteps approaching]

#### DAVID [continued]

A--are we doing a--

##### [door whooshes open]

#### TREXEL

##### [he starts stumbling over his words here, getting rapidly less coherent]

Harto! Hartro, please, I can explain! It's all David's fault! I haven't entirely worked out how, but I'm absolutely, 100% convinced that if it wasn't for this clone idiot, I would have been here on time. In fact, I would have made you a drink! I'd have made you a wonderful drink! Maybe even a plate of-- a plate o--of delights, a little-- a little-- a little-- soup--

#### DAVID [interrupting, deadpan]

Hello, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I-- Hello David. W-- you're not Hartro!

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Where's Hartro?

#### DAVID

...Who?

#### TREXEL

Hartro! Hartro, our line manager! Th--this is review day, it's review day, and I'm--

#### DAVID

Oh, so that's why we haven't got a brief. No, she's not here.

#### TREXEL [in awe]

She's not here.

#### DAVID

No one's been here all day, during the shift which you didn't turn up for.

#### TREXEL

David, this is wonderful. David, this is an absolute Boardsend! David, don't you understand? It is review day! And, Hartro is supposed to be here! And she's supposed to look through all the planets we've designed, and--and tell us whether we did well, or badly, and I have to admit to you, David, I was sort of dreading this, because normally, at the end of a review, [__DAVID:__ Mm?] I get told off, [__DAVID:__ Yes?] and the clone gets recycled! [__DAVID: [very concerned]__ Oh!?] because the planets are terrible, David! [__DAVID:__ Oh...] We did *not* do a good job!

#### DAVID

Well, it-- it's good we missed that, then, eh?

#### TREXEL

##### [heeled footsteps approach]

It is absolutely incredible that she has-- I dunno if she's forgotten about us, I don't know if she-- if she-- if she doesn't care anymore, but either way, David, either way--

##### [the door whooshes open]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Line Manager arriving!

#### TREXEL

Oh, Hartro!

#### HARTRO

Oh, hello! Hello, Trexel!

#### TREXEL [nervous laughter]

H--Hartro!

#### HARTRO

And... David?

#### TREXEL

Yes, David-7!

#### HARTRO [excited]

##### [much less excited]

Oh, yes, new David! Oh, yes, new David.

#### DAVID

Hello.

##### [Trexel tries to say something, but Hartro ignores him completely]

#### HARTRO

Right, move right along there. I'm just gonna be [__DAVID:__ Um.] using that chair, David.

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, yes, okay--

#### HARTRO [sing-song voice]

##### [laughs]

To put my shopping on!

#### DAVID

I'll just... stand in the corner.

#### TREXEL [nervously, as he always sounds while talking to Hartro]

We were just talking about you, Hartro!

#### HARTRO

Oh, me? Oh, my ears were burning. [__forced laugh]__

#### TREXEL

"Wh--where's Hartro? I hope we get to do a review soon!" But we've obviously all been here, waiting for you, quietly and happily, just waiting here, in this room, where--where we should have been!

#### HARTRO

Oh, yes, yes, I've changed something. Somewhere in your body, there's a lovely little tracker now, so I--I never have to sit and wait for you again!

#### TREXEL

A tracker? You put a tracker in my body?

#### HARTRO

Yes, don't worry, you were asleep. It only hurt a little bit, but we gave you a sedative and then we erased that part of your memory.

#### TREXEL

Right! Right. So, you-- you--

#### HARTRO

And don't try to find it, 'cause we put it somewhere really deep.

#### TREXEL

...Okay! Um, that's a lot to take in. I'm gonna admit, Hartro, that's a lot to take in, but okay, so that-- that means you know I--

#### HARTRO

Know where you are.

#### TREXEL

--haven't, necessarily been... here. All day.

#### HARTRO

No, no, that's why I've only just shown up.

#### TREXEL

Right!

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

This makes-- this makes so much sense. This-- this makes a lot more sense than-- than what I thought.

#### HARTRO [overlapping the last few words]

In fact, according to my--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Employee movement history.

#### HARTRO

--according to my beep moving around-- Do you see this little flashing light?

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Is that me? Is that me?

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

That's you, yeah.

#### TREXEL

Lovely! Look, there I am.

#### HARTRO

So, and you can see where you've been. [__TREXEL:__ Yes in the...] Yeah, you've been in the Cosmic Lounge [__TREXEL:__ Yeah, been there.] for one, two, three, four hours! Oh, fi-- That's the smell, isn't it?

#### TREXEL [over Hartro humming sardonically]

##### [stammers/ laughs]

Yes, it does somewhat, uh, somewhat get into the old clothes, the, uh--

#### HARTRO

Interesting.

#### TREXEL

Cosmic stank.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. So, we'll start a log, David.

#### DAVID

A log?

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

#### DAVID [stammering]

Uh, yes, yes, yes, no, sure, I can do a log, that's-- my job!

#### HARTRO

Right!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Performance review log.

#### HARTRO

And I'd like to say for the record that Trexel's shown up drunk, we'll say. [__TREXEL:__ I'm not drunk!] We'll call it drunk.

#### DAVID [slowly]

Drunk...

#### TREXEL

I would say, tipsy! David, can you put--

#### HARTRO [over Trexel]

Drunk.

#### DAVID

Drunk...

#### TREXEL

David, could you put down 'tipsy?'

#### DAVID

Drunk.

#### HARTRO

There we go. D-R-U-N-K.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Drunkenness logged.

#### HARTRO

Lovely. Right! So, now that I've established that I know where you are all of the time, uh, we'll move on to the review! [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Cheerio! Great. So, I'm just looking at the last four planets. We'll call 'em planets, eh, I dunno, you call 'em something else, but, yes, that you've been responsible for. I'd like to just put this under the umbrella of "ego." I'm gonna call it that. "Ego." That's-- that's the overriding problem I have with these last four planets. Let me flesh that out for you: Nurturer 163.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Right, so, your *ginormous* ego, has created two thousand three hundred and ninety-two murders. [__TREXEL:__ Murders...] You have killed hatchlings on that planet. I don't know what you thought you needed to be doing, other than designing a planet, at the Cosmic Lounge, having a shante around the deck, but because of your lack of detail, of skill and design, we now have hatchlings, that are never going to see their parents. Never-- never grow up. Never work for Stellar Firma, perhaps.

#### TREXEL

W--what happened?

#### HARTRO

You had them in a boiling trough, and it's very important for a hatchling to have the *exact temperature*! You wrote down "right shade of boiling."

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

You *fried* them!

#### TREXEL

So, it was so hot, that the water boiled off, and then it turned into basically a big frying trough, and-- and what we've made is essentially a dish.

#### HARTRO

You cooked their children in front of them, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

That's... not what we were going for.

#### HARTRO

Not exactly, no.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

I think that is a fail, on your part.

#### TREXEL [quietly]

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Now, David: would you say Trexel is spending time in a design session?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### HARTRO

You're allotted, uh, let me see... 8 hours, I think, per planet.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

So, 8 hours. Somebody-- somebody who wanted to invest, and care about the planets they're creating, somebody that might want to actually have a client enjoy a planet that they're making, might spend 8 hours on a planet.

#### DAVID

I-I'd assume so, yes.

#### HARTRO

Someone with a ginormous ego, who might rather be drinking, or perhaps lazing and sleeping, would spend...

#### DAVID

Roughly about... 20 minutes.

#### HARTRO

Oh! Right.

#### TREXEL

What-what a coincidence! That's normally the amount of time I spend-- oh, I see what's happening here.

#### HARTRO

Yes. Right, I'm going to need something. David, do you have any sweets, do you have any liquid...

#### DAVID

Um.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammering]

Some bonbons and refreshments! [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] Bon-- for our guest! For our guest Hartro! Any-- anything-- anything to refresh, fresh her parched, parched mouth?

#### DAVID

No, I can't get out of this office. I'm trapped in this office. I can't, can't--

#### TREXEL

##### [confused noises from David]

I'm so sorry about this, Hartro-- David, David come over here. Come over here, David. We have some facilities over there, over there, you see those pipes? You-- where you get your--your slurry and your nutrients.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Well, use some of them! That's a drink of some sort, isn't it?

#### DAVID

O--okay?

#### TREXEL

##### [to Hartro, laughing nervously]

Pop over there and get a glass, and-and give it to Hartro. I'm so sorry about him, Hartro, he'll be right back with a lovely refreshment.

#### IMOGEN [beep] [crosstalk]

Employee refreshment unit online.

#### HARTRO

Stop waving your hands around me. [__TREXEL:__ I apologize.] Just-- sit down.

#### TREXEL

I'll sit on them! I'll sit on them! I'll sit on them!

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk]

Clone slurry selected.

#### TREXEL

It's like I don't even have hands anymore! They're gone. They're gone. No hands Trexel, they call me.

#### HARTRO

And can you just... look at the wall for a minute. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] I don't want to see your face. [__TREXEL:__ I'll look at this wall--] Oh, David!

#### DAVID

Um... your glass. Of... slurry.

##### [sipping, Hartro gags and spits it out loudly]

#### HARTRO [very angry]

Is that clone slurry?!

#### DAVID

Well, it's-- the liquid I--

#### HARTRO

Agh! You do NOT give a line manager clone slurry! Do you know what that could have done to me?!

##### [David makes a small "uhh" noise]

#### TREXEL

David, I can't believe this!

#### HARTRO

Sit on your hands, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry.

#### HARTRO

In fact, Trexel, [__TREXEL:__ Yes?] take one hand out. [__TREXEL:__ O-okay?] Drink that, you idiot.

#### TREXEL

##### [trails off]

It's clone slurry! I-- uh--

#### HARTRO

Right. Do you know how to operate a slurry machine?

#### TREXEL [apparently, he's drunk some of the slurry]

Oh, god.

#### HARTRO

Obviously not.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's horrible, it's so--

#### HARTRO

Drink it all. Drink it all.

#### TREXEL

##### [gagging]

It's so sharp and tangy!

#### DAVID

...Um.

#### HARTRO [overenunicating, slowly]

I want line manager snacks. Alright?

#### DAVID

I'll go find another tube.

#### TREXEL

##### [very quickly]

##### [various retching and gagging noises]

Please David, please, please get the right tube. She's going to make me eat whatever you bring back if it's not line manager snacks, David, I plea, I implore you, find the right slot or tube or whatever it is over in that corner, I don't look over there very much and I need this David I can't drink any more of this-- ugh, it smells like hot socks.

#### HARTRO

Moving swiftly on. [__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Consultant recommendation file.] Burn Market, 23rd Earl of Armica.

#### TREXEL [still gagging on the slurry]

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Right. Now that was, that was a whopper.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Employee refreshment unit online.

#### HARTRO

Right, so, somebody suffering from ego would definitely build themselves, I don't know, a giant ivory statue of themselves? In the middle of the planet for someone else?

#### TREXEL

Well, some could say that's a sign of ego, yes--

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Access denied.

##### [David yelps as the machine gives him a nasty electric shock]

#### TREXEL [continuing on his merry way]

I can see, maybe you are tying this massive statue I made into a broader theme?

#### HARTRO

Good. That's exactly what I'm trying to do.

#### TREXEL

But-- but-- but-- but-- perhaps it's just, you know, a signature!

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Access denied.

##### [David is shocked again, and lets out more loud yelps]

#### HARTRO

It's interesting how you had all the other parts of the planet all aligned to look at that ivory statue in the middle. What an *interesting* choice.

#### TREXEL [failing to be convincing]

Well, everything has to face somewhere, Hartro, and it just so happens my... statue... is in the middle.

#### HARTRO

Yes, and the orbit? It's all circulating around this statue in the middle.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Access denied.

##### [David, yet again, wails]

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, I see your point, and I apologize. Oh, David!

#### HARTRO

Just-- Speak.

#### DAVID [voice trembling]

I touched the line manager tube, and it-- it just-- it tazed me. I couldn't get any, um...

#### HARTRO

Oh, of course, you don't have clearance. Ooh, interesting! Trexel, could you please go get me some line manager slurry?

#### TREXEL

Me?

#### HARTRO

Yes, please.

#### TREXEL

Me. Go get the... drinks? Uh, ...Yes! Yes, yes, of course, I'll-- I'll go get the drinks.

#### HARTRO [whispering]

##### [IMOGEN: [error buzz]

Now, David, do you see what I've done here? See, now he also doesn't have access [__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Employee refreshment unit online.] so in a moment you're going to hear a Access denied.] really, really sharp-- well, you've been through it, haven't you?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

##### [Trexel lets out a yelp much louder than David's. There's a bit of a pause]

#### TREXEL

...So it turns out I--I'm not allowed line manager slurry or juice either, and I have been tased.

#### HARTRO

##### [she makes some groans of ion scrub euphoria]

Hm! ...Right, that's fine, I don't need a drink, it's fine, I've had several drinks. I'm going for an ion scrub later anyway, ahh!

#### TREXEL

What a wonderful life you lead, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

I want to move on. [__IMOGEN: [beep]__] Consultant design recommendation file.] Right, we've got Mitsy Van Shuten, ring a bell? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Oh, there's a whopper. Oh, we've got a mess. Legal are up to their eyes in it right now. You've created a life and death gun.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes, I--I must say, I thought this was one of our-- one of our highlights. You know? Giving the client--

#### HARTRO

##### [stammering]

No, no, no, let me stop you there. No, no, no. You've given-- you've given the power that only Board should have, someone-- someone of great knowledge and understanding, and yet you've given it to-- anyone, anyone on that planet can now just pick up a gun, and kill or bring back to life something. They're trying to bring back dogs that have been dead for years, their mom and dad, oh my! So-- so teenager comes home, had a bad day, oh, kill dad, oh, bring dad back to life-- it's very difficult, mentally, to deal with such a-- [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] *power*.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I see how having control over life and death, over everything you survey, might, *maybe*, cause a little bit of, shall we say, emotional distress. Um. Yes. Are they-- are they doing well down there? Are they-- are they adapting? Y'know, as creature can-

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Well, Trexel, I'm not going to mince words, here, uh. We've had to completely destroy the planet. No, we-- we pushed that right into a sun.

#### TREXEL

You pushed it into a sun?

#### HARTRO

Well, we needed to! I mean, luckily, we were able to contain it, and nobody left the planet with one of those guns, 'cause-- well, I don't know what we would have done then. I mean, there's only so much I can cover up! [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] Yeah, so, no, there's-- there's a whole planet on your shoulders there.

#### TREXEL

Wow. And, everybody-- everybody on-- everybody-- [__HARTRO:__ Every.] on the surface [__HARTRO:__ Every single one.] all dead.

#### HARTRO

In fact, we had to get a team to pull them out, and they're dead as well.

#### TREXEL

That's-- that's a lot.

#### HARTRO

All because somebody thought they might want to make a God gun.

#### TREXEL

Yes, puts things in-- in perspective, I suppose.

#### HARTRO

I mean, I wouldn't be able to sleep.

#### TREXEL

No, I must say, there's been a couple of-- a couple of-- couple of, ah, wakeful nights, y'know? Couple of sessions in the Cosmic Lounge, more than I'm used to, since I've learned about all the deaths I've caused, I'm sure. Anything-- anything else, Hartro?

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Ah, but you know, we can move on, can't we? [__TREXEL:__ Yes! Yes!] Put on a smile! [__TREXEL:__ Put on a smile.] Yeah, we've got to trudge ahead, don't we? Some of us just have to lead the way.

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk] [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Well, one last planet. Oh, that was the one for the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective, wasn't it? The Winter Lettuce Collective. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] We weren't too sure about them, were we? [__TREXEL: [laughing]__ No!] A--are they a murderer, are they not? [__TREXEL:__ Who knows? Who knows!] Did they-- did they destroy their whole band, did they not? I dunno.

#### TREXEL

Who can say?

#### HARTRO

I know, I know what we should do! [__TREXEL:__ W--what's that?] We should give them *two rooms* with explosives in! Oh, oh, I know, I know, we should give them a whole gang of dogs and strap knives to their heads! [__TREXEL:__ Knives... to their heads.] Yeah, yeah, sound familiar?

#### TREXEL

Yes, no, that is ringing a couple of bells, and-- and now you say it back to me, giving a potentially murderous lead singer access to... quite a lot of explosives and many, many well trained knife dogs... some people could look at that and say "What have you idiot?! What have you-- what have you done, you *massive idiot!*"

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

What *have* you done?

#### TREXEL

So-- so-- is it-- is it all worked out fine?

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel stammers]

...No. [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, we've got-- we've got a dilly-dally down there. Oh, yes. [__TREXEL:__ A dilly-dally?] Oh yes, yes, yes, not the good kind either. [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] You know they like to have lots of parties?Musicians... [__TREXEL:__ Yes, something like that--] Oh, just party after party, getting all sorts of famous, lovely, galactic artists, just- bringing them to that planet, and then destroying them.

#### TREXEL

Destroying them?!

#### HARTRO

We've got-- some of our greatest artists, now, have been knifed and/or exploded, because of this planet that you've created! You've created a hedonistic party deathmatch!

#### TREXEL

...A hedonistic party deathmatch?

#### HARTRO

That's what you've created!

#### TREXEL

I mean, that sounds pretty great, but I'm getting the feeling that--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I mean, *they're* happy! Couldn't be happier!

#### TREXEL

Well, well-- you know what they say! Client knows best, client first, if-- if the client's happy, then-- then-- then maybe the deaths of many of the galaxy's greatest artists isn't too much of a...

#### HARTRO

Lemme stop you there, there. No no no, because when some of the greatest artists end up being sent off and killed, ooooh, Stellar Firma Ltd. gets taken to court, don't they? [__TREXEL:__ Ah.] Oh, and legal are up to their heads trying to defend this! [__TREXEL:__ Well, I--I--] It's a new low.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well you've-- you've really put things into perspective for me there, Hartro. You've- you've really laid it out on the line.

#### HARTRO

And with this knowledge, I want you to* learn.* I want you to look at yourself and say, "it's not all about me."

#### TREXEL

Do you-- Do you want me to do that now?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Um, right. So I'll... I'll just uh-- can I look at you? Or do I need to-- [__HARTRO:__ Don't ever look at me.] Okay, I'll just look in this mirror here. Trexel. Hello! Looking-- looking good! Did you do something with your face, haha? Yes. Ah... Hey. Buddy. Old Trexe-y boy. Old Geistaroo.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

You can't do it, can you?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you...

#### HARTO

"It's not all about me."

#### TREXEL

It's not all...ways, but sometimes-- look, now, between you and me, I love you. That's important. But, sometimes, you need to take a long hard shower with yourself, and think, "hey, Mister. Old Geistyboy. Old Trexeloo. You're so handsome! But the important thing is that sometimes, somethings, might not be about you, entirely." Oh, gosh. That was tough. That was tough. That was hard.

#### HARTRO [unimpressed, crosstalk]

Yeah, I saw that was tough. No, no, we're going to do it again. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, again?] We're going to do it again. Don't romance yourself. Okay?

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Okay, just right into it. Just right into it.

#### HARTRO

I want you to say "it's never about me. [__TREXEL:__ It's never about me--] It's always the client." [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] And I'm just going to stick my foot, just, right into your mouth. [__TREXEL:__ Into my mouth?] Just like that.

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel gags. His voice is muffled around her foot]

Oh, okay, uh--

#### HARTRO

Right. It's not ever about me-.

##### [Trexel says something muffled]

#### HARTRO

##### [a groan]

Look in the mirror, Trexel! Look in the mirror!

#### TREXEL [muffled speech]

#### HARTRO

What?

#### TREXEL [muffled speech]

#### HARTRO

When is it about you?

#### TREXEL [muffled]

Never!

#### HARTRO

What?

#### TREXEL [muffled but determined]

##### [more gagging]

It's never about-- --always about the--
#### HARTRO

Who is it about? Who is it about?

#### TREXEL [gags]

##### [starts sobbing and repeating the word 'client']

The client!

#### HARTRO

Alright, there we go, there we go.

##### [TREXEL gasps for air]

#### TREXEL

Did I do well, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Well, you started to cry, and that's what I was going for.

#### TREXEL

Well, ah... thank--thank you, Hartro. Thank you, for doing that. You have a delicious foot. Clean.

#### HARTRO

David. Just... Clean that for me. [__DAVID:__ Uh] Just clean that foot for me. [__DAVID__: Your-- Your foot.] Without touching me with you. Find something to clean it. [__DAVID:__ A-- A spritzer...]

##### [two spritzes of water]

#### TREXEL

Shine that foot right up.

#### HARTRO

Alright, stop that.

#### DAVID

Yeah, alright, yeah-- yep.

#### HARTRO [sigh]

Well, I think my work is done. Hmm! So, moving forward: you learned a lesson today, didn't you, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Ab--absolutely. [__HARTRO__: You did.] It's not-- it's not all about me.

#### HARTRO

[__interrupting__] It's *never.*

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's *never* about me.

#### HARTRO

[__threateningly__] Do we have to do it again?

#### TREXEL

No! No, no no no-- [__HARTRO__: I will get my foot out again.] please, please [__HARTRO__: I will take my foot out again.] I don't think I could take the joy. It's *never* [__HARTRO__: I'm not above it.] about me.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I understand, I--I--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Fantastic.

#### TREXEL

We--we can do this.

#### HARTRO

Right, so! I'm off to the ion scrub! It's been real, Oh, it's been great. Didn't we have fun? I had fun! Didn't we have fun?

##### [weak agreement from both]

#### HARTRO

David, stop talking. Didn't we have fun?

#### TREXEL

Lots of fun.

#### HARTRO

Aww.

#### TREXEL

I look forward to it, ah, next Friday!

#### HARTRO

Well done, us!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Line manager departing.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Bye!

##### [door whooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Bye Hartro.

#### DAVID [shellshocked]

...Uh.

#### TREXEL

Oh, David.

#### DAVID

Yes, so, um...

#### TREXEL

Oh, David.

#### DAVID

So, what happens now?

#### TREXEL

##### [suddenly upbeat]

Oh, David. I have neverhad such a good review in my entire life, do you understand? That was incredible!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

I'm going to celebrate at the Cosmic Lounge. [__DAVID:__ Um.] I will see you at some point in the future!

#### DAVID [crosstalk, hurried]

No, early on Monday!

#### TREXEL
