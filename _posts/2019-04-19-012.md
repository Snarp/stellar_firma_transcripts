##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [sighs, muttering to himself]

##### [louder sigh]

##### [footsteps approach]

Is he up there? Let's-- it-- Trexel? Are you in the vent again? Trexel, please come out. Look, if you've got stuck, tap once--

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

Ahhhhh, David!

#### DAVID [startled]

Ah! Ah!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

Access granted

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, how are you?

#### DAVID

Uh, yes. Thank you, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Why are you standing on a chair looking into a vent, David?

#### DAVID

Well I thought you might've-- you did leave by the vent, so I thought maybe you--

#### TREXEL

Did I, David?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Did I leave by a vent, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] or was that perhaps a clever ruse and I actually left by a door?

#### DAVID

No, you definitely left by the vent.

#### TREXEL

No, you are right, David. I have been crawling in the vents again. But that chapter of my life is over. [__DAVID:__ Ah.] You know, it was a number of hours after I left last night, and I was still crawling around, and I think I might've got a little smidgen of radiation poisoning crawling near a reactor somewhere. But I'm fine now. And, and when I came out and, you know, I was having a hot, radiation-removing shower in my quarters and I--

#### DAVID

You-- you are looking quite bleached.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

I just thought to myself, "Are vents really for you anymore, Trexel? You're not a young man. You know, you've got gravitas. You've got-- you've got pull around you, you've got sway. Sure, they do that thing where they, you know, laugh and walk away and, you know, whenever I visit The Board they always make me, you know, wait for hours and hours in an antechamber and then pretend that they didn't know I was there and then, and then close. But I-- I have people to impress and I can't be scrambling around in vents if I'm going to be a, if I'm going to be doing that, am I?"

#### DAVID

Hm? No, no, not at all.

#### TREXEL

No, so I walked here, *tall*, wearing my best trousers.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Look at them.

#### DAVID

Yes. They're very-- very nice. Yes. Plaid.

#### TREXEL

See? Plaid.

#### DAVID

And s-- Is that... eight pockets?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you can't have too many pockets, David. Give me one good reason why more pockets is worse than fewer pockets. One reason.

#### DAVID

Pocket vermin.

#### TREXEL

Pocket vermin. David, that's just a friend you haven't met yet.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL [singing]

♪ Little friend in your pocket. Ooh yeah. Ooh yeah. Little friend, don't you stop it. Oh no. Oh no. Your li-- ♫

#### DAVID

##### [interrupting]

Oh, look! Here comes the next brief!

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Right. This one is from... Bathin, the Great Duke of Galactonium.

#### TREXEL

Bathin?! Of Galactonium, well...

#### DAVID

Uh, yeah. Yes. Uh, they need a place to keep their precious stones. Um, that's what they want the planet for. And the one design feature they *must* have is that denizens can only move by transporter.

#### TREXEL

Old Bathin. You know, I went to school with him?

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

Yes, yes. It's a human, old Bathin. Yes, we were... we were friends at school. Well, I say friends. He held me upside-down into an airlock *until I went blue*! But then obviously he, uh... his father is the Duke of Galactonium, so he went off and-- off and did that while I, uh, got a job at the old Firm.

#### DAVID

Well--

#### TREXEL

The old Stellar Firm.

#### DAVID

I mean--

#### TREXEL [chuckles]

The old Stellar Firma Ltd. is what I'm saying. So yes-- wh-- I-- I-- I know him, ah, pretty well. Pretty well.

#### DAVID

Okay--

#### TREXEL

He's done very well for himself!

#### DAVID

Well--

#### TREXEL

##### [slight laugh]

Which of course I'm absolutely delighted by. Obviously only because his father was the *old* Duke of Galactonium. And obviously anybody can have a rich father--

#### DAVID

But-- I would--

#### TREXEL

But obviously I don't think my *mother* was the reason that, that I have a position here.

#### DAVID

I mean, it-- it--

#### TREXEL

But he was a real... a real ding-dong about it, you know, David?

#### DAVID

It does say--

#### TREXEL

You know when someone's like... just really makes a *thing* about it?

#### DAVID

So-- so is his dad just the Duke of Galactonium?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Well, he's the *Great* Duke of Galactonium. So...

#### TREXEL

Oh, it-- it escalates.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

That's the whole-- Galactonium-- Do you know about Galactonium?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

##### [slightly under his breath]

##### [normal voice again]

Well Galactonium, it is a little bit of a sore subject around here. It's a *human* colony.

#### DAVID

Oh, right.

#### TREXEL [carefully choosing his words]

They... disagree... with how... Stellar Firma... exists. You know, you know? Obviously, our history-- You, you've been in IMOGEN, you understand that obviously when we escaped the, uh, the Great Desolation that destroyed the Earth--we did that, by the way--but once we escaped that thing that we did. And then we discovered that maybe there was a business for our, for our terraforming technology. And so Stellar Firma was born. They did the pivot, the Great Pivot, you remember? And then some people were like, "Hey! I don't want to be a citizen-employee that's indebted to a faceless Board for all eternity!" for some reason. And they just left. They took some shuttles and left. And--

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

--that was, that was hundreds of years ago.

#### DAVID

And how do-- So, could you tell me a bit more about Galactonium? 'Cause it, it sounds so *awful* that I just wanna be absolutely sure that I never want to go.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [recorded]

Defectors to *"valued customer"* Galactonium will be eliminated.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

##### [chuckles]

Oh, yes. Of-- of course. So they found an uninhabited planet. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] And they, they had stolen some terraforming technology and they turned it into a sort of--what would you call it--a paradise. A paradise. Obviously they haven't got the tech we have here, but, you know, they used what they had, and they made a verdant wonderland of earthly delights, and they've lived there ever since. And, you know, relations have been strained at times but we've come to a sort of a détente. You know, they are now a rich trading post. We are obviously still a *massively* powerful corporation. Every now and again someonechucks a photon beam where it shouldn't go. But mostly, you know, we get on. And the Grand Duke, obviously, he's a relatively important cast member. But, uh, as I've said... real ding-dong at school.

#### DAVID

*Great*. GreatDuke.

#### TREXEL

What'd I call him?

#### DAVID

*Grand* Duke. You should probably...

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, the Great Duke.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Oh, the Grand Duke.

#### DAVID

I mean it--

#### TREXEL

Oh, wow, a Duke!

#### DAVID

It is his--

#### TREXEL

Big Papa Duke! Swingin' around his scepter!

#### DAVID

W-- no, no, it's the *Great*... the *Great* Duke.

#### TREXEL

So, yes, the Great Duke is somebody that--

#### DAVID

Of Galactonium.

#### TREXEL

Of Galactonium. That we, uh--

#### DAVID

Bathin.

#### TREXEL

Bathin--

__TREXEL and DAVID: [simultaneously]__ The Great Duke of Galactonium.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, yes. Thank you, David. Thank you, David. So yes. Obviously, you want to do a fantastic job.

#### DAVID

Well, yes. Because--

#### TREXEL [annoyed]

Heaven prevent his Dukeship should have a substandard planet.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Stellar Firma Ltd. is pleased to remind you that employee enthusiasm is mandatory.

#### DAVID

##### [placatingly, pitch going up, trying to get Trexel on board]

Uh, but-- and, heaven forfend your career record would have a substandard planet in it as well! Sooooo we wanna make a good planet?

#### TREXEL [grumbling at first, pitch rising to match David's]

Hmm, *okay!* I'm ready to go!

#### DAVID

Alright! So, he needs somewhere to keep all of his precious stones. And from what you've--

#### TREXEL [interrupting]

"Oh! I've got so many precious stones! Look at me! My-- my-- my *nine* pockets are overflowing with stones, so I need a whole *planet* for them!"

#### DAVID [under his breath]

He's probably got more than nine pockets, but--

#### TREXEL

You-- you-- I've got the most pockets, David.

#### DAVID

Well, you've got more pockets than me, Trexel! So--

#### TREXEL

Yes, you've got no pockets, have you, David?

#### DAVID

No, this one is--

#### TREXEL

You've got a featureless boiler suit.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Old no-pockets David over there.

#### DAVID

Actually, it's strangely slick.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

The boiler suit. It's got a hydrophobic-- I keep sliding off of things.

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes, well, we wouldn't want you to get damp. What if you got moldy?

#### DAVID

Uh, wh--

#### TREXEL

Then we'd have to clean you!

#### DAVID

W--

#### TREXEL

What a mess that would be!

#### DAVID

Well, I-- I have had an itch for the last two weeks--

#### TREXEL

Oh you'll get massively dry skin, David. Oh my god! Your skin probably does need some moisture. But your itchy skin is less of a problem than you being a filthy, hot mess!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Anyway, clothing choices aside, he wants a planet to keep his precious stones on.

#### DAVID

Yes, lots of stones. Obviously enough stones to need a planet.

#### TREXEL

Yes, sure.

#### DAVID

And has to have one that denizens of the planet-- so, apparently-- or, you know, I don't know if, if he wants it to be a, a habit-- habitable planet [__TREXEL:__ Hm.] that people go to? Or, uh, maybe somewhere that they go to see his stones? Or that he needs a large staff to look after all of his stones because there are just so, so many stones. As the Great Duke of Galactonium, he's very rich and powerful, and has lots of stones. As you said, it was... a big trading post full of precious, nice things [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] that *he* has.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. David, do you want to, [__DAVID:__ Maybe... all...] do you want to continue to talk about how fantastically rich and wonderful he is? And I--

#### DAVID

Well, well I'm just trying to get into the head of the, the *Great* Duke of Galactonium.

#### TREXEL

Ohhh, you're really getting on my wick aren't you, David?

#### DAVID

Oh. Yes. Precious stones-- I don't know what you mean.

#### TREXEL

Keep on just circling back round to how fantastic and--

#### DAVID

So he--

#### TREXEL

You know what, he was really bad. You know what he was really bad at?

#### DAVID

Being...

#### TREXEL

Drinking.

#### DAVID

Really bad at drinking.

#### TREXEL

One drink? Old, old tipsy boy, he'd become.

#### DAVID

Sounds quite cheap. Probably why he's got so much money now.

#### TREXEL [whispering menacingly]

##### [normal voice]

Oh, you always know how to turn it around, don't you, David? A viper in my bosom. A knife in my heart!

#### DAVID

Very slick.

#### TREXEL

Do you want your knife back, David?

#### DAVID

Very slippery, itchy knife.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Slippery snake knife detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

*So*, his stones?

#### TREXEL

Yes...

#### DAVID

Uhhh we need somewhere to keep them and the people who-- I-- I think, probably, given that it's a planet, probably all three. So you're going to need some staff to look after the stones.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

You're going to need people who come and visit the stones.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes.

#### DAVID

And people to look after the people who come and visit the stones they look after.

#### TREXEL

It's your standard denizen package, David. You don't need to over-complicate things. We know how staffed planets work!

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### TREXEL

If you've got a thing you need to keep, you need people to keep it, you need people to come see it because that's why you're keeping it, and you need people to keep the people keeping it and seeing it happy. That's your-- that's your standard three denizen package.

#### DAVID

Alright. Okay. So that's not so... difficult.

#### TREXEL

So, this is all about security, David. Because as much as I don't like the man, his key concern will be: Are. People. Touching. My. Precious. Stones. Because the one way to lose a stone is to have people touching it. Because touching leads to grabbing, and grabbing leads to taking, and taking leads to stealing, and stealing leads to prison. And then obviously your parents bail you out of prison and they say, "Trexel, *Trexel*, you sot! You've disappointed us, once again!" Hit me! Hit me!! *Hit me.*

#### DAVID [sarcastically]

What a coincidence that the man in that story was called Trexel as well.

#### TREXEL

Isn't it?

#### DAVID

Yes, very... strange. Um. So. Yes. So, security! So, security.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes, very important.

#### DAVID

So we need a large security force.

#### TREXEL

We need a vault! A vault planet.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

A vault planet. Now, a vault planet-- One thing about a vault planet is it doesn't need a lot of other things that a regular planet needs. An atmosphere: don't need it. You-- It's already on the inside.

#### DAVID

Yes. But those-- The vault needs denizens.

#### TREXEL

I've got-- You've misunderstood me, David. You understand what an atmosphere is? What's an atmosphere, David?

#### DAVID

It's, um, when you go to a party, and you like--

#### TREXEL

David, I'm going to stop you right there, David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

In terms of a *planet*, what is an atmosphere?

#### DAVID

So it's when you go to a *party* planet, and when you land you're like, "Ah! Help! There's no oxygen here! And I'm dying because of the hot, hot sun!"

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Okay, I-- I stopped you too soon, David. It-- w-- you are is absolutely correct. That is what an atmosphere-- Now, on a regular planet, that atmosphere? It's outside. It's on the surface. But if you're in an enclosed space, that's not an atmosphere, David, that's just what's inside. And you don't need things like, you know, gravity to hold it in, or all this other complicated stuff. You just need a *big steel box*. And inside that box? Sure, we might have trapped some oxygen. And yes, there might be air filters, but we just don't have to worry about all the general-- You know, the thing about-- the thing about atmospheres is so much of it just flaps about, you know, on the surface of a planet, being exposed to space, getting hot, getting cold, all these complicated things. In a vault planet? You just lock it all in!

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

Trap the air! Three strikes and you're in!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Get in there!

#### DAVID

Alright. I'm... getting inside.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so we're going to have a-- a-- a vault planet.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

Doesn't even need to be circular, David.

#### DAVID

Sure.

#### TREXEL

Curves, curves are costly. Let's make it a big square. Big box.

#### DAVID

Okay. We haven't, we haven't done anything that's not a ball for awhile, so--

#### TREXEL

No! I think the last one was a pod? And it was sort of pod-shaped, rather than ball-shaped.

#### DAVID

Yeah, we'll do a big, big cube.

#### TREXEL

So it's gonna be a lovely, a lovely big box.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So, inside that box, there needs to be a way of getting in and out that needs to be secure.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So how, how are we gonna do that?

#### DAVID

Umm--

#### TREXEL

My first thought, the entire side of the whole vault planet opens up. Hundreds if not thousands of square-kilometers of side just opening up onto the vast vacuum of space.

#### DAVID

How's that gonna work?

#### TREXEL

I-- I absolutely don't know, David. I imagine expensively, and I imagine a few denizens might die every single time it happens.

#### DAVID

So, actually, that's a good question. I did have that question. Is-- What is Galactonium's attitude to workers and their rights?

#### TREXEL

Oh! They. Do. Not. Care for them. As the name implies, it's a feudal system, David! You're not a Grand Duke or a Great Duke or a Big Daddy Duke Boy if you want people to have, you know, *rights* or *say* or anything like that. You know. Even here, even here: we call ourselves citizen-employees.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Certainly, at any moment, the Board could decide that, that we are... no longer needed and get rid of us. Or-- or IMOGEN could, could consider our waste output to food input balance off and-- and get rid of us that way. But at least there's a system in place.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You know? There are *reasons* these things happen. Whereas in a feudal system, if the Duke looks at you and thinks, "Hmm, I don't like your face," you're gone!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And that's why they're called "denizens" and not "citizens".

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Is that 'cause they live in dens?

#### TREXEL

They do all live in little dens.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Back-- back on their home planet, everybody's in a little den. Sometimes, you know, if you're really fancy? You've got a shack. If you're-- if you're *really* fancy, you might have a cave! If you're *incredibly* rich, that cave might have a door. But if you're a little bit richer? That cave doesn't have a door anymore, because it's *open-plan*, David. You see? You go backwards and forwards through the features. That-- that's-- that's how it works.

#### DAVID

Mmmmm--

#### TREXEL "

I've got an open-plan cave. It's got a kitchen-dining area that the rain gets into. Because I'm... middle class!"

#### DAVID

Right, well, I'm gonna take your word for that one. Okay, so, we'll have the whole range of dens for the denizens.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

And the side of the planet's gonna just open up.

#### TREXEL

Just open up.

#### DAVID

Just open up.

#### TREXEL

You know what? Let's put the dens on the inside of the door.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Then, if anything's gonna get destroyed and sucked off into the vacuum of space, it's gonna be denizens, the Duke won't mind.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You know, it just-- it's just a-- it's a system that regulates itself.

#### DAVID

Okay. So we have this--

#### TREXEL

Big, steel cube.

#### DAVID

Yes, so a big, steel cube with one side of it opens up.

#### TREXEL

Ah, yes!

#### DAVID

A lot of dens everywhere.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispering]

##### [normal voice]

Oh! I've got a thought about the art of this! It-- You know what? Often we don't get to flex our design muscles, David. You know, we're always thinking about features and structures [__DAVID:__ Yeaaaah...] and all of this kind of stuff? When really, we should be thinking about how it-- how it looks aesthetically.

#### DAVID

Yes... if we had more time.

#### TREXEL

*All* of the controls... are full-scale. Buttons... two *miles* across. You have to ram a spaceship into it to press a button, for example.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And then you've gotta turn a big wheel. But that wheel is three *hundred* miles across. And you've gotta just-- you've gotta just get like six spaceships and you need to-- to put them all on each of the spokes and accelerate them and some of them slip off and smash and explode. You know, it's-- it's-- it's basically, you know, like a small safe you'd have, like, in a room?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It's that but huge!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Just enormous!

#### DAVID

With a whole population of denizens to operate it.

#### TREXEL

Just-- just all-- all on the inside of one door.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

They maintain the mechanism, because--Remember this mechanism? It's gonna have like, like, uh, holes, that in a regular safe wouldn't be big enough for a piece of dust, but a *whole* denizen's gonna be able to walk through that. Sure, they might get crushed by some piece of moving equipment but they're a denizen! That's what they're for. Their blood will lubricate the mechanisms!

#### DAVID

Ooh. Okay. Well, f-- fine. Let's go with that.

#### TREXEL

When you crush a body and it lubricates a mechanism, could you call that *goobricating*? Because you become a sort of a goo. Like, I've smashed you into a lock, and now your-- your rendered flesh and blood, like, that goo? It's goobricated it!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

We could patent that!

#### DAVID

We could.

#### TREXEL

And, and Hartro couldn't say we haven't explained it! Because that is fully fleshed out! You know what? That's what we-- That's the tagline. Goobricated corpses: a fully fleshed out product from Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay, yes, but we're not making goo--

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

This is wonderful. Let us-- Go on IMOGEN and trademark goobrication.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

No, no-- We're not making--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Goobrication: patent-pending.

#### DAVID

##### [pauses to count]

We've only done one side! What's happening on the f... five other sides!

#### TREXEL

Well, they're just *plain*. The outsides are fine.

#### DAVID

Okay, so the--

#### TREXEL

It's the inside that's massively complicated that we need to get to.

#### DAVID

Right. So, so... what are we doing [with] the vault? The vault, right, what is the vault? You're opening up the side of the planet [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and then what? Is it just another, smaller safe?

#### TREXEL

No, no, it's not, it's not, it's not-- That would be so unoriginal. What? Just safe upon safe upon safe with fewer and fewer denizens living in each one. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Maybe choosing *smaller* denizens-- Oh my god! That would be amazing! So let's just within that safe, there's another safe.

#### DAVID

Nested safes.

#### TREXEL

##### [slightly manically]

And just average height of the denizen is just a little bit lower, [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] and they're living in smaller houses. And you open that one, smash a couple of denizens up to goobricate the mechanism. Open that one up, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] these ones are really uncommonly small! And you open up that one, and you keep on going, until it's the *children*. The children are the denizens! And the shortest children are the denizens at that! And they're going, "Wah! Wah! Would you like to get at the stones?" And you're like, "*Yes*! Gimme the stones!"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Child labor detected. Consultants encouraged.

#### DAVID

Okay, so, good. So basically, we have about... a hundred and forty nested safes [__TREXEL:__ Thereabouts.] operated by smaller and smaller people--

#### TREXEL

And then eventually children.

#### DAVID

--and then eventually children. And then there's basically just a big room full of stones.

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Okay. Fine! Good. Now, we need to get to the other part of the brief which is that all of these denizens have to travel by *transporter*.

#### TREXEL [whispering]

Right.

#### DAVID

And I don't know what, um, that means by "transporter". Is that a transport system? Is it a teleporter? What do the Galactoniums like? And bearing in mind, we have one minute and ten seconds to do this bit. What was--

#### TREXEL

Hmm. What would a stuck up, snooty idiot think was a good idea?

#### DAVID

What was Bathin's favorite-- What did he come to school in?

#### TREXEL

What did he come to school *in*?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Sort of a chute.

#### DAVID

A chute?

#### TREXEL

Sort of like a-- like a smooth chute that would just sort of roll him along like a big, stupid egg.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right.

#### TREXEL

So when he thinks a transporter, he just thinks a series of chutes.

#### DAVID

Well, that's transport.

#### TREXEL

Yes, well, I suppose it's--

#### DAVID

So it's just loads of slides?

#### TREXEL

I feel like we've done chutes before though.

#### DAVID

We have, and--

#### TREXEL

And you know what?

#### DAVID

No--

#### TREXEL

I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna play to his game. You know, chutes are *stupid*, I think.

#### DAVID

No, no. But, Trexel, *yes*. Think about the beautiful irony of you're making a planet for Bathin and you're reusing old ideas and he doesn't even know!

##### [the following is panicked, overlapped crosstalk between Trexel, David 7, and IMOGEN in the background]

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes! Yes!

#### DAVID

So I'm gonna put slides.

#### TREXEL

They ride around on dogs! You've written that down?

#### DAVID

What? No!

#### TREXEL

They ride around on dogs!

#### DAVID

Slides-- That's not a transporter. What?!

#### TREXEL

They-- Dog-- Oh, right. Fine. They ride around on dogs, the dogs ride in chutes.

#### DAVID

Okay. Fine.

#### TREXEL

Is that a compromise?

#### DAVID

Yes. Dogs in slides.

#### TREXEL

Is that a compromise?

#### DAVID

Dogs in slides.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Would you like to submit?

#### TREXEL

Each of the dogs has shaved into its fur "Bathin's an idiot."

#### DAVID

Okay, no, we have to-- I'll just--

#### TREXEL

"Bathin's an idiot!" Just shave the dog with that!

#### DAVID

No, I haven't written it down. No, no, no, no. It's gone. It's gone, it's gone, it's gone.

#### IMOGEN [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

##### [panicked crosstalk ceases]

#### TREXEL

Ah! I feel like that's teamwork.

#### DAVID

Phew!

#### TREXEL

Teamwork makes the dream work, David.

#### DAVID

Uh, that was a close one. And I feel like I wrote about three sentences.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, well, did you write down "You've shaved into the--" What did we shave into the dogs in the end?

#### DAVID

"Bathin's an idiot."

#### TREXEL

"Bathin's an idiot." And that's in the brief?

#### DAVID

No. No. There's dogs on slides.

#### TREXEL

You didn't write-- That was all I wanted in it, David!

#### DAVID

Well, I had to-- I had to--

#### TREXEL

If we didn't have anything else, I wanted a dog with "Bathin is an idiot" shaved into the side.

#### DAVID

Then why did you-- why did you say it two seconds after the deadline?!

#### TREXEL

Because I thought of it then!

#### DAVID

G-- Trexel! If you had-- Trexel--

#### TREXEL

When I say something after the deadline--

#### DAVID

No! Trexel!

#### TREXEL

--think of it *beforehand*.

__DAVID and TREXEL: [indignant interrupting noises at each other]__

#### DAVID

*No!* You are *consistently* here *twenty minutes* before the deadline.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

If you'd come even-- Think about it. If you'd come even a minute earlier, we'd have had dogs with "Bathin's an idiot" shaved into-- Think about the amount of things that *you* have *lost* from doing that. So think of how many things we could've shaved "Bathin's an idiot" into if you turned up when you were supposed to *eight hours ago*!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sass detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Are you... are you quite done? Your little temper tantrum over there, David?

#### DAVID

Well, I don't think that *echoing* what Hartro said...* to you*... is really a temper tantrum! I don't think that's a temper tantrum! I think that's just... honest and-- and-- and-- and forthright feedback!

#### TREXEL

Is this about your itchy skin?

#### DAVID

*No!*

#### TREXEL

Is it about yo-- Do you want some moisturiser, David?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

I'll get you some moisturiser, David. Look, when you want some moisturiser, David, you don't need to make up the, a whole rigmarole--

#### DAVID

No, it wasn't--

#### TREXEL

--about me being late or on time--

#### DAVID

No, I wasn't making it--

#### TREXEL

--and that being a problem and us shaving things into dogs.

#### DAVID

No, it-- It is--

#### TREXEL

If what you're saying is, "Trexel, I've got an itchy back," then just say it, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, no no. Okay, I *do* have an itchy back--

#### TREXEL

Just say it.

#### DAVID

I do. I have an itchy back.But--

#### TREXEL

Oh, you've got an itchy back? *Thank you*, David.

#### DAVID

No no no no no. But-- but this isn't--

#### TREXEL

Thank you for admitting that, David.

#### DAVID

No. But it's not-- This isn't--

#### TREXEL

Thank you for coming with me and allowing me to *explore your body*.

#### DAVID

This isn't-- Trexel--

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

I'll get you moisturiser, David. I hear-- I read you loud and clear. What's-- I'm just tuning into, into, into Radio David 7. Tuning in there. And what I'm hearing is: I'm so itchy itchy.

#### DAVID

Turn up earlier. Turn up earlier.

#### TREXEL

I'm so itchy.

#### DAVID

Turn up earlier.

#### TREXEL

I'm so itchy.

#### DAVID

Turn up earlier.

#### TREXEL

Get me moisturiser.

#### DAVID

*Please*, turn up earlier.

#### TREXEL

I'm so itchy.

#### DAVID

Turn up earlier.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

You've made your point, David. You've made your point.Alright, I'll go get some moisturiser. And I will see you bright and early tomorrow evening. Alright, bye-bye!

##### [door swooshes open]

#### DAVID [muttering menacingly]

I'll moisturise *you*, you great, big fff--
