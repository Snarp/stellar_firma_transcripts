Special thanks to tk ðŸ˜”ðŸ¤™for today's submission! May hot sky rocks disrupt your evolution for the better.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

...ffffffffffffffffffffffffffface. Wait. How long was I doing that?

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Ugh. Ohhh.

#### DAVID

Is it tomorrow?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

*Beavers*. Ohh, galloping woofs. Ohh... Knife. Edge. Eyes shining bright.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

What do beavers got to do with it? Wait, hang on. What's the time? Oh, it *is* tomorrow! You're still late.

#### TREXEL

David. David. [__DAVID:__ Yes?] It wasn't my fault, David. It wasn't my fault. I have--

#### DAVID

Wait. Hang on, Trexel. *What* wasn't your fault?

#### TREXEL

I can see in your face, *and* on the face on the clock that--

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel. What is specifically the problem that you are apologising for?

#### TREXEL

Okay, *you* seem to think that I should arrive at a certain time. Okay. I'm willing to accept that you think that. I... disagree, *but* I understand that it worries you.

#### DAVID

And Hartro doesn't.

#### TREXEL

Sure. But is Hartro here?

#### DAVID

Well, no. But she *will* be here on Friday.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Well, in which case, I don't have much object permanence, David. If she's not here, I don't really know. You're Wednesday. I'm Wednesday!

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

It's Wednesday. You're halfway through. I'm not Wednesday!

#### TREXEL

We're all-- We can all agree we're all Wednesday!

#### DAVID

No. The day is Wednesday.

#### TREXEL

And I thought, "Yes. I'm going to try harder." And I thought, "You know what? You know what my scaly, itchy friend needs? [__DAVID:__

No, I'm not ac--] moisturiser." I know you got very angry about moisturiser last time. [__DAVID:__ No.] We were talking about time but we all knew it was about your itchy, itchy skin because of your hydrophobic suit.

#### DAVID

Well, okay. Well, you haven't arrived on time, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] but

have you at least brought the moisturiser?

#### TREXEL

Well, that's an interesting story. And links into why I'm... as late as usual. I was--

#### DAVID

So, you admit you were late?

#### TREXEL

You may think so. I could not possibly comment further. I--

#### DAVID

##### [muttering to himself]

You said the word "late."

#### TREXEL

--went to find some moisturiser. [__DAVID:__ Right.] You know, from one of the commissaries. You know, Dan's Smooth Skin Alliance.

#### DAVID

I don't know any of these places, I've never left this room.

#### TREXEL

Soft Jack?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

I Can't Believe They're Not Made of Butter.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

All of these places and more could have sold me and I found a wonderful product for you. And I thought, "Yes. I've done incredibly well. Well done, me. Hurray for Trexel."

#### DAVID

So where is it?

#### TREXEL

I then... went to a party. And, yes.

#### DAVID

Was it a moisturiser party?

#### TREXEL

No, but many of the people there were soft skinned. I stroked some of their faces. I asked first. I didn't wait for an answer but I stroked the face. And it was soft. And one thing led to another, and at one point I did-- I did drink, umm, the moisturiser. And--

#### DAVID

##### [disappointed]

Why did you drink my moisturiser?

#### TREXEL

It's hard to say in the cold lamps of day but I think-- I think it's because I thought I had a scaly windpipe. And esophagus. And... whatever else has happened, David, I have a very soft neck. I mean, I can't even begin to tell you, David. I've got a real soft neck.

#### IMOGEN [beep, pleased]

Smooth innards detected.

#### DAVID

Well, good. Hopefully this soft neck will allow the ideas to flow freely from it because the brief is here.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, you know what? Thank you for forgiving me.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Thank you.

#### DAVID

No... no. But we have to get on with it because we have about 18 minutes left. Roughly. Give or take.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Alright. Wind your neck in. I'll wipe my soft neck out. Crank. Crank. Crank.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

So, the next client is Psilax Bromius. [__TREXEL:__ Oh. Okay.] They want a planet because, uhh--

#### TREXEL

Is it a colloquial one, David? Is it written in prose?

#### DAVID

I will just read out this--

#### TREXEL

##### [interrupts]

Just read it out. Read it out as submitted.

#### DAVID

##### [uptalk]

"My dad said I could have *my own planet* to hold sick parties so I wouldn't trash  his?"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Teen prose detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

"If you make it cool, you're invited to the planet warming. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, lovely.] It's B-Y-O-Wine--" don't know what that means, [__TREXEL 'mmhm's__] "--and if you have a cult following as well, I guess they're invited, too." The non-negotiable feature is "Brah." I don't know what "bras" have to do with it.

#### TREXEL

It's something for holding mammaries.

#### DAVID

Right. So, they've called us bras.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

"The moon has got to have an in-built strobe light."

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, sure.

#### DAVID

##### [uptalk]

"What's a good planetary rave without a strobe  moon!!!!" [__TREXEL 'mmhm's knowingly__] I wouldn't know. I've never been to a planetary rave.

#### TREXEL

You've obviously never encountered much punctuation there because I know you've got all the bits but the intonation was weird.

#### DAVID

Well, there were four exclamation marks.

#### TREXEL

Well, they don't multiply, David.

#### DAVID

Are you sure?

#### TREXEL

##### [extreme uptalk]

Hang on. Show it to me.  "Moon!!!!" No, okay, alright. Fair enough. Fair enough. Fair enough.

#### DAVID

What is B-Y-O?

#### TREXEL

B-Y-O. Um, "Because You Own."

#### DAVID

Ok, it's Because You Own Wine. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Ok, so we're invited to the planet warming because we own wine. I don't own any wine.

#### TREXEL

I own lots of whine.

#### DAVID

Oh, well that's good. I suppose you're invited.

#### TREXEL

High pitched. Low and growling. Because I'm lost. Because I'm hungry. Because I've become angry.

#### DAVID

No, it's whine without an "h." It's wine as in the liquid, the alcohol.

#### TREXEL

No, I don't-- I don't have any wine. You know wine is incredibly-- You know the last time I saw a grape? Never! Because, you know, they went extinct. But I'm sure some people have reconstructed grapes.

#### DAVID

Well, apparently Psilax Bromius. [__TREXEL:__ Yeeees.] Um, they're obviously very rich... [__TREXEL:__ The wine.] they have a party planet, and they can afford wine.

#### TREXEL

"Rich enough for a party planet, rich enough for wine!" That's the old saying.

#### DAVID

And expect their guests to have brought their *own* wine!

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Rich guests!

#### DAVID

So they have rich friends, yes.

#### TREXEL

David, I'm not gonna lie... you know I love my job. Because...

#### DAVID

You don't turn up to it.

#### TREXEL

Mostly, I don't turn up to it, and-- and-- and-- and people don't give me *nearly* as much trouble as you'd expect about that, but...  [__DAVID:__ Well...] Today, do I want to be talking about parties, David?

#### DAVID

Yes, because it's your job.

#### TREXEL

I... have a very mad, bad, mad bad -- I have a *mad* and *bad* headache. It's so bad it's mad, and I really don't want to talk about parties, drinking, a strobe moon... I *do* like a strobe moon! But now I just--

#### DAVID

Well, if you like one, we're going to have to talk about one! Because we--

#### TREXEL

I just want to lie down in the corner, David.

#### DAVID

No, we have--

#### TREXEL

Why don't *you* handle this one, and I'll have a little nap?

#### DAVID [flatly]

*I* handle this one?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, why don't you handle-- for a change, David, why don't you? [__DAVID:__ [__sarcastic]__ For a change.] You know, right-- David, you're right. That would be a disaster. All right, all right. I'll let-- I'll let you lead, though. What do we-- what do we need to cover?

#### DAVID

Well, we need a planet that's specifically to hold sick parties. [__TREXEL:__ Okay. What do you-- what do you need?] Given that I have never, ever been outside this room or attended a party, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] ill or otherwise, I don't really know-- Do people like ma--?

#### TREXEL

Parties 101, David. Parties 101. Let's--let's start from base principles. Parties 101.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

When do they start? No one knows. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] No one's told you. There's no way to look it up. You've just heard there's a party.

#### DAVID

So this planet has to always be having a party [__TREXEL:__ Just always having...] so that whenever you arrive there's a party happening.

#### TREXEL

Maybe you were busy. Maybe you were drunk at another party. *Maybe* you've got sudden amnesia because, you know, of the drugs. It's all possible. [__DAVID:__ Right.] So you just have a party constantly going so it's a 24-hour party planet.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Party 101, Part 2. Everybody's kind of irritated that you've arrived, but you've not established why. Everyone's giving you the side-eye, they're like, "Oh. Trexel." And you're like, "Hey... you." And they're-- you know, you can tell something's off but you've already had a few drinks so you don't really care at that stage. So, everybody should be on edge, bit suspicious.

#### DAVID

Is that because you haven't been invited to those parties?

#### TREXEL

Invited?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

You have to be invited to a party?

#### DAVID

Yes, I mean it's literally-- "If you make it cool, you're invited to the planet warming."

#### TREXEL

##### [light bulb moment]

That's what that means!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I just turn up. I just hear "party" and then I just walk into the room.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And sometimes people say, "Hey, you--" but I've already gone. So, I've never really heard the other end of that sentence. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] So is it, "Hey, you. You're not invited." is what they're saying?

#### DAVID

I would assume-- Yes. Maybe.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

Well, unless you were invited. [__TREXEL:__ No.] Have you ever been invited to a party?

#### TREXEL

Well, company parties, sure! I'm an important person. For some reason...

#### DAVID

Okay, well, how was it at company parties?

#### TREXEL

At company parties... there's nibbles.

#### DAVID

Okay. Nibbles.

#### TREXEL

Nibbles... nibbles aplenty. Never enough food to stop you from becoming so drunk you're ill, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] but nibbles to make you thirsty with their salt to-- to drink more. I've never quite understood the reason of a-- of nibbles at a party.

#### DAVID

So, please, um, elucidate on-- What is a nibble?

#### TREXEL

A nibble?

#### DAVID

A nibble.

#### TREXEL

It's like a small thing.

#### DAVID

Is it like the slurry that comes out the wall?

#### TREXEL

No, no, no. That's sort of a nutrient mush. You need that to live but it's not fun. No, a nibble is like a little... a little...

#### DAVID

Is it fun but it will kill you?

#### TREXEL

A nibble?

#### DAVID

Well, if it's the reverse of the nutrient mush, which, you know, I need to live but it isn't very fun. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, no. Umm...] Is a nibble really fun but will kill you?

#### TREXEL

Could do. If you choke on it. Problem with the nibble, about the width of a windpipe.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Pop it in there, like when you pop a coin in your windpipe when you're young.

#### DAVID

So, they're about coin-sized?

#### TREXEL

Did you ever have a coin popped in your windpipe?

#### DAVID

I was never young. Or I am young?

#### TREXEL

Father used to pop a coin in my windpipe most days. Mother would say, "Yes! Do it!" ...Ahh.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Stellar Firma Ltd. would like to remind you that the inhalation or consumption of coins is not permitted.

#### DAVID

And was that a nibble?

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

No, that was just a thing they did. But, uh, but it taught me the value of money, which is to say,  "Get it out of my neck!"

#### DAVID

Okay. But nibbles you want *in* your neck?

#### TREXEL

But nibbles... Nibbles do go in your neck.

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ But they're about coin s--

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ But remember, there's two holes in your neck, David. [__DAVID:__ Two, yes.] There's two holes in your neck.

#### DAVID

Both of which are very smooth, apparently for you.

#### TREXEL

##### [excited]

##### [yells]

They're very smooth, especially if you're me. One of them is for nibbles. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] And I suppose slurry. [__DAVID:__  Yes!] And most liquids. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Not if they're too hot. The other one, mostly for gas. In, out. Whatever. But just don't put the wrong thing in the wrong one. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] All of the sudden your body's like,  "What are you doing?!"

#### DAVID

So, nibbles are coins for the right pipe.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Nibbles... Yes, nibbles are like edible coins for the right pipe. You pay your stomach in nibbles and guess what it pays up later. Vomit.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Congratulations! You've bought some vomit.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You obviously need to, you know, have alcohol with that as well. But you know, at the end of a long day, y'know, you cash out as I like to shout through the vomit. Cash out in an alleyway or up against a sleeping person and then, you know, that's your reward for the party.

#### DAVID

Okay, so that--

#### TREXEL

Have I made parties clear to you?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Uh-- well, so-- Acco-- Okay, so, you go... to a place where everybody's suspicious of you.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Eat too many coins.

#### TREXEL

Far too many coins.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Do *not* eat coins.

#### DAVID

Drink [__TREXEL:__ Or--] alcohol because the coins have made you thirsty.

#### TREXEL

Thirsty coins.

#### DAVID

Then you vomit on *something*. [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] Either a wall or a person.

#### TREXEL

Well, you can't vomit on no-- You could vomit into a vacuum, I suppose. But that's very poor form. It just *hangs* there.

#### DAVID

And then you leave?

#### TREXEL

And then you leave.

#### DAVID

So, what else happens? Is it just-- So--

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes, yes, yes. I remember. When you're in the party, things just start to become blurry.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And then-- and then you can't really work out what things are.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And then it's day.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, well-- okay so we need a day-night cycle [__TREXEL:__ Yeah-- oh, of course.] because it needs to become day.

#### TREXEL

Because then it's day party and they're a different type of party. A day party, you're not allowed to eat as many coins or be as drunk. Obviously, I still am. But you're not *supposed* to be. They tend to have more sandwiches than nibbles as well. So maybe there needs to be some-- This is a catering heavy planet, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, so we need--

#### TREXEL

We need kitchens.

#### DAVID

We need kitchens.

#### TREXEL

The core of the planet is a kitchen. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Pumping out food at an *incredibly* high rate. Staffed with-- I don't know, robots. Can we make more of those IMOGEN robots? I mean, sure, they'll have a lot of other knowledge as well [__DAVID:__ They don't-- But we could just--] but just whack them in. Get the gold gondoliers! Get the goldoliers in! We've got to have spare goldoliers. Wack 'em in!

#### DAVID

No, they're supposed to all be very unique, so we explicitly don't have *spares*.

#### TREXEL

But one of them was a baker! Remember one of them was a baker? [__DAVID:__ Yes.] He could bake bread.

#### DAVID

And-- no, no, he used to bake bread and now he's a gondolier.

#### TREXEL

It never leaves you, David. It's like-- it's like cycling.

#### DAVID

No, we need-- we need it for the gondolier.

#### TREXEL

Fine, fine, fine. If you don't want-- if you don't want an economy of use of gondolier-gold-robot-with-baking-background, sure. Fine. Alright.

#### DAVID

Well, wait--

#### TREXEL

Okay. Do you want new robots then? Or maybe staff?

#### DAVID

Staff?

#### TREXEL

Staff means sleeping quarters, David. Staff means, you know, wear and tear.

#### DAVID

Do people not sleep at parties?

#### TREXEL

No! People at parties are 24-hour party people.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, how do they live and not go mad?

#### TREXEL

##### ["Days Of Our Lives" voice]

You don't live on the planet. Otherwise you-- Well, yes, either you leave the planet at a certain point-- The party's always happening. [__DAVID:__ Okay. So--] The people come and go.  Like the sands of time, washing over the shore. [__DAVID:__ So, what you're saying--] Out of your bath. Aww, your floor's sandy now.

#### DAVID

What you're saying is we need another place where people can go and sleep. Some sort of, umm-- a place for them to relax and get out of the party. Some sort of chill out moon.

#### TREXEL

Some-- a chill out moon! Yes! Alright. But we're going to have to put it on the opposite side of the planet of that strobe moon. It's hard to chill out, even on a chill out moon, when there's a *big strobing light*!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Excessive moons warning. Collisions likely.

#### DAVID

Well, unless you're *inside* the strobe moon.

#### TREXEL

Oh! The inside of the strobe moon--

#### DAVID AND TREXEL [simultaneously]

--is the chill out room!

#### TREXEL

That-- that is excellent. That is excellent. Chill out room in strobe moon. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] You could put that at a top of a slide in a presentation and people are like, "Go on."

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, I'll-- I'll quickly make up this slide to the Build Team.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Opening PresentMax build presentation system.

#### DAVID [muttering,

__crosstalk____]__ Strobe moon... and it needs to get a... just going to look at IMOGEN...

#### TREXEL [muttering,

__crosstalk____]__ Strobe moon... Nice!... There's the spot...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Opening: Strobe Fact File.

##### [high-pitched whining alarm]

##### [David and Trexel yelling]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Ceasing strobe.

#### TREXEL

So that's a strobe, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] That's a strobe. Now, you would think surely that's some sort of punishment because you've been bad. People like it. People want it.

#### DAVID

Yes. I-- All my movements went jerky like I was some sort of puppet.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes. You become a dance puppet.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, dancing happens at parties?

#### TREXEL

Oh, sure.

#### DAVID

Facilitated by the strobe moon... strobes in general?

#### TREXEL

Sure. Well, the thing is, everybody hates dance. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You know this is a true thing. Everybody pretends that they like to dance but everyone while they're dancing is just constantly thinking, "Oh God, is this dancing? I'm not sure. Wait. Maybe I should watch some sort of instructional holovid beforehand. But it's *too late now*! I'm already moving." And everybody else is actually looking at them thinking, like, "That's not dance. This is dance. Wait, hang on a minute! Is this dance? Maybe I should have watched some sort of instructional holovid!" And then someone is watching them and saying [__DAVID:__ Ahh, yes, I'm seeing...] "That's not dance. This is dance. Oh wait, is it dance?" And just on, and on, and on, and on until the party's over. But the party never stops on this planet.

#### DAVID

Okay, so. Well, the moon's going to have to orbit. So, wherever the strobe moon lands [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] is the dance place.

#### TREXEL

Lands?

#### DAVID

The light of the-- the strobe of the strobe moon.

#### TREXEL

I was going to say, David. Because if a moon lands, that's not a landing, that's a disaster. When the moon lands, *the party's over*!

#### DAVID

Okay, so that's how people know when to go home.

#### TREXEL [yells]

What, when the moon *smashes* into the planet?!

#### DAVID

Yes. Well that means that Psilax Bromius, when they want to close the party, can just crash the moon in.

#### TREXEL

Do you underst-- The gravitational forces involved-- Because the two bodies will smash together. It will create an *enormous* amount of heat. All of the rock will vaporize and become lava. And yes, that is a very good way of telling people to go home.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Yes. They also will be dead and your party moon's *ruined*. I should know. I've crashed my fair share of party moons into a planet before.

#### DAVID

Well you... but you survived.

#### TREXEL

Oh yeah-- I did it remotely, sure.

#### DAVID

Well that means-- Well yes. So, we give Psilax Bromius the ability to remotely crash their party moon into their party planet if they want the party to *end*.

#### TREXEL

Gosh. That is... that is a full-on way of ending a party.

#### DAVID

People will talk about it.

#### TREXEL

They will... Well, the *survivors* will talk about it.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

They will have had to probably been inside the chill out moo-- No, the moon will get hot as well!

#### DAVID

Well, you could bring a select few with you [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] to tell the story of your party.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes. They survive so they can warn others.

#### DAVID

Or, attract others.

#### TREXEL

Sure. What, people who are... who want to go to a death party?

#### DAVID

Well, yes, because that means that Psilax Bromius will have to get another planet off of us!

#### TREXEL

Ye-ee-ees! "Welcome to Party Planet. The best, and last, party you'll ever attend."

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

Brackets: "Because you'll die."

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well-- okay that's-- that's-- that's the basics there, David. So, we've got a [__DAVID:__ Okay.]-- we've got a party planet. [__DAVID:__ Well--] It's got a kitchen in the middle.

#### DAVID

Ahh. Details, details. Yes. So, yes. No, sorry. Were you going to go into detail?!

#### TREXEL

Might have been. I-- I thought that it would--

#### DAVID

No. Please continue, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

No, you put me off now.

#### DAVID

No, no. Please, please, please. There's a kitchen in the middle.

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

You're not going to make fun of me if I--

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well. So, we've got this party planet and there's a kitchen in the middle. We're going to staff the kitchen with, let's say robots. Because it's low-- it's lower maintenance. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] And there are fairly well-established automated kitchen systems. You don't need automatons walking around. It can just be some sort of production line. People are hammered! They don't really care-- You know what? You can serve a quiche that's just a rhombus. Not even a proper square.

#### DAVID

What's a qui--

#### TREXEL

They won't notice.

#### DAVID

I thought we were making coins.

#### IMOGEN [beep, irritated]

*Please* do not eat: coins.

#### TREXEL

Oh, coins are a metaphor for anything I happen to be talking about at the time. The coins that you feed yourself-- "coins" in order to "pay" for the vomit. [__DAVID:__ Oh. Oh.] The nibble-- the nibbles. Remember when we talked about nibbles being food?

#### DAVID

##### [whispers]

Yes. I thought the nibble-- Okay, I'm going to scrub out--  that nibbles are not--

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Did you write--?  Or, we could put some sort of *mint* in the middle of the planet. And just stamp out coins and just put out bowls of coins.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Please refrain from eating coins.

#### DAVID

Are they... are they nibbles?

#### TREXEL

You could nibble them. You would die.

#### DAVID

So-- oh, so they're not--

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

And then my mother and father would be standing there saying,  "Choke on the gold, Trexel! Because that's all you really care about, you *spoiled little idiot*! Choke on the gold!"

#### DAVID

And this-- and this happens at parties?

#### TREXEL

Well, it happens at my parents' parties.

#### IMOGEN [beep, voice breaks]

Stop eating coins.

#### DAVID

Do we want that--

#### TREXEL

It's not important. They're dead now. But what's important is that we probably need a kitchen, David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Lose the mint idea.

#### DAVID

Okay. They're not--

#### TREXEL

You don't need a mint!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

We've got plenty of money here, David.

#### DAVID

Well then-- Wouldn't-- Will the Build Team understand what nibbles are?

#### TREXEL

Oh, sure.

#### DAVID

Okay, so the kitchen's making--

#### TREXEL

Nibbles are pretty basic.

#### DAVID

I'm going to put a capital "N". [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Nibbles.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's a proper noun now. We want--

#### DAVID AND TREXEL [simultaneously]

"Nibbles."

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Yeah. They'll understand. They'll understand.

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Yes. Okay. Good.

#### TREXEL

Mini quiche. Those little cocktail things.

#### DAVID

##### [repeating Trexel]

Mini quiche. Little cocktail things.

#### TREXEL

You know, just stick a little stick into something: it's a Nibble.

#### DAVID

Anything with a stick in it?

#### TREXEL

Pretty much anything with a stick in it.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right, well, I've got three examples.

#### TREXEL

Just... poke it-- poke it into the side of a horse. Horse is a Nibble.

#### DAVID

Horse-on-a-stick. Okay, so that's--

#### TREXEL

Poke it into a wall. The wall that the house makes: the house is a Nibble. You know, that's how it works.

#### DAVID

That's definitely a Nibble?

#### TREXEL

I'm pretty sure. [__DAVID:__ Wall-on-a-stick.] Have you ever seen something with a cocktail stick in it that's not a Nibble?

#### DAVID

Never seen a cocktail stick.

#### TREXEL

Well-- Answer my question.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Well, my point is made.

##### [...]

#### DAVID

Okay, well, we've got five examples. That's detail. [__TREXEL:__ That's pretty detailed. That's pretty detailed.] Hartro will be pleased. So, we know the Build Team knows what Nibbles are. And then, as the moon orbits, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] the strobe moon, it has a roving dance area. Where, when the strobe touches, they must dance? I think?

#### TREXEL

They must dance!

#### DAVID

But, on the dark side of the planet, where the strobe moon is not--

#### TREXEL

That's deep rave territory.

#### DAVID

Deep rave?

#### TREXEL

That's deep rave.

#### DAVID

Oh, I thought it was Nibbles territory.

#### TREXEL

No!

#### DAVID

What's a deep rave?

#### TREXEL

A deep rave?

#### DAVID

Actually, what's a rave?

#### TREXEL

Okay. A rave-- right, you're angry but you're also dancing and really sweaty and somebody gave you a tablet. That's a deep rave.

#### DAVID

That's a *deep* rave?

#### TREXEL

It's dark. You're feeling great. Your body's gone weirdly cold and you're not self-conscious about dancing anymore. Deep rave!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. And these-- these tablets?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Are those Nibbles?

#### TREXEL

Of a sort. Food for the brain. [__DAVID:__ Brain food.] Some have said.

#### DAVID

Brain food.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So-- Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

Have too much brain food, you forget who you are.

#### DAVID

So, Nibbles for the brain.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Just write that down. They'll get it.

#### DAVID

"Nibbles for the brain."

#### TREXEL

But put "*wink*" after it.

#### DAVID

Umm--

#### TREXEL

Nibbles for the brain... *wink*.

#### DAVID

Wink.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

I'm talking about illegal drugs, David.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Illegal drugs detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so, we-- we've got the deep rave side. No, what?

#### DAVID

No, I was--

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

No, you looked worried.

#### DAVID

I was just thinking. Umm-- we are running out of time and I was just wondering, is there anything else that *dancing* needs apart from strobes?

#### TREXEL

Hmm. You've got strobes...

#### DAVID

And. And, Bromius specifically wants the party to be *cool*. So...

#### TREXEL

Hmm. Ooh, David, there is a small thought.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

It's a party.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You're dancing.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

There's lights flashing.

#### DAVID

Mmhmm.

#### TREXEL

What are they flashing to?

#### DAVID

I don't know.

#### TREXEL

A beat, David. A beat is the *heart* of music. We need music is what I'm saying.

#### DAVID

We need music. Okay.

#### TREXEL

We need music. And we need cool music. Now, David, I-- I--

#### DAVID

What is cool music?

#### TREXEL

That's a *very* difficult question, David. I could talk for hours and hours on the subject and still I wouldn't know.

#### DAVID

You have about twenty seconds.

#### TREXEL

Cool music is music that I'm pretty sure is stupid but I'm too afraid to point it out.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I'll send you a playlist.

#### DAVID

Well, no, I've typed that up. I hope the Build Team know your music tastes.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Oh, well they probably-- Well, they-- they've actually-- We-- we all subscribe to IMOGEN's music service. And we share-- we share a playlist. So, I've just got mine that just says,  "This frightens me!" and that will-will probably--

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Alright, so play anything that frightens Trexel. Okay, so that's good.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Anything that frightens me. Ohh, so loud!

#### DAVID

We've got music that's cool. We've got Nibbles. We've got strobes. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] We've got the dark side and the light side. We've got the chill out room which is just a moon full of cushions?

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ All the floor should be lights. All the floor of the planet should be-- should be flashing with colored lights.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, the floor of the planet is flashing with colored lights. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] The room is--

#### TREXEL

The dance floor. Oh no, we didn't talk about the chill out room!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, we've got ten seconds.

#### TREXEL

##### [confirmation sound]

Umm, it's blue in there. [__DAVID:__ Yep.] There are also Nibbles. [__DAVID:__ Yep.] It just goes from hot to cold all the time without any warning. __IMOGEN:__ Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. It's gone.

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

#### IMOGEN

Submitting!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. It's gone.

#### TREXEL

There we go.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

There it is. There it is. Ohh! Fluid.

#### DAVID

No! What? No fluid!

#### TREXEL

Yeah, no, we didn't include any fluid, David. When you're dancing and eating and-- and-- and you've-- you've taken "brain food," you do need drinks. We didn't include any drinks.

#### DAVID

Wait, did Nibbles--? Are Nibbles not fluids?

#### TREXEL

No! Nibbles aren't fluids. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Nibbles are a solid. A fluid is a drink. A pick-me-up. A wet friend.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, the last time I tried to put anything up the pipe-- [__TREXEL:__ Don't! No!] a gun came out.

#### TREXEL

It's too late. It's too-- Yes.

#### DAVID

So, I'm not going to-- I don't think we can--

#### TREXEL

No, no. That is a sacrosanct space. Now, you try and get anything in there--

#### DAVID

A gun comes--

#### TREXEL

--IMOGEN will deploy a gun out of there.

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ Yeah, I-- She-- she-- She did.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ And they'll say, "Hey. Buster. What are you doing?"

#### DAVID

I said that I was just-- just looking.

#### TREXEL

Mm, yeah. What did IMOGEN say?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Watch it, buster!

#### DAVID

Watch it, buster.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, she will.

#### DAVID

And then the gun went back in.

#### TREXEL

She says "buster" a lot.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

It's weird.

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

I don't know why IMOGEN is so colloquial.

#### DAVID

I don't know what "buster" is.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's like, umm... I'll explain when you're older, David.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, we got the planet done.

#### TREXEL

In a way.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I would prepare yourself. We had *no* fluid on that planet.

##### [David groans]

#### TREXEL

That's not-- that's not ideal, David. And I'm a little bit upset that you--

#### DAVID

Well. Ahh-ahh! But everyone has to bring their own wine.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Oh! Everybody has to bring their own wine! David, you've done it! David, you've done it! They're bringing the fluid.

#### DAVID

Well, I mean, Psilax Bromius did it [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] by saying it's "Bring Your Own Wine."

#### TREXEL

Yeah, and that's-- and that's *in* the suggestion, so that'll be in the submission document by default.

#### DAVID

I wonder if we're going to be invi-- I've never been to a *party*. Let alone a party planet.

#### TREXEL

Well, obviously you're not allowed to leave this room at any point other-other than if you're specifically instructed to by the IMOGEN, me, or the Board, so.

#### DAVID

Well, Psilax Bromius is going to invite me.

#### TREXEL

Oh, oh, sorry. Is Psilax Bromius your-- your leading superior?

#### DAVID

Well, I mean...

#### TREXEL

Is Psilax Bromius Hartro Piltz, your line manager?

#### DAVID

Well, they're a client.

#### TREXEL

*Is* Psilax Bromius the Board?

#### DAVID

No, but they're--

#### TREXEL

Is that what you're saying?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

That's blasphemy.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

A gun will come out of a light.

#### DAVID

No, I--

##### [gun appearing, building itself]

##### [low tone beeping]

##### [whirring noises of a gun tracking potential victims]

##### [Trexel and David whispering]

#### DAVID

Don't-- don't move.

#### TREXEL

Is there-- is there a gun coming out of that light.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It's above me, isn't it?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Just say... say, "Psilax Bromius isn't the Board."

#### DAVID

##### [normal]

Psilax Bromius is not the Board. The Board is powerful. Umm... the Board is all. I love the Board.

#### TREXEL

##### [normal]

I would also like to add at this point, apropos of nothing, I'm a big fan of the Board.

#### DAVID

Hail the Stakeholders.

#### TREXEL

Hail the Stakeholders.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hail the Board.

##### [gun disassembles and retracts]

#### DAVID

Oh, it's gone. Okay.

#### TREXEL

There we go. You see how close that was, David?

##### [David sighs]

#### TREXEL

So-so, I'm going to let you answer your own question. Do you *think* you're going to this party?

#### DAVID

##### [wistfully]

I'd like to.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Answer the question.

#### DAVID

I'd like-- No.

#### TREXEL

You don't think you're going. Because you're not going.

#### DAVID

No, no. I'd like to go to the party.

#### TREXEL

You'd like to go to the party.

#### DAVID

I'd like to go to the party.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well. You can like as much as you want, David.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, I will continue to like to go to the party.

#### TREXEL

##### [pauses]

Good. Well.  Maybe I'll try and see if there's a way it can happen. But I'm not promising you anything. Because remember last time I tried to get you something, I drank moisturiser!

#### DAVID

Please don't drink the invite.

#### TREXEL

I wonder if you could drink paper? I'm going to go try and drink some paper. [__DAVID:__ Wait, what?] Right, if I'm not back it's because I've died from trying to drink paper.

#### DAVID

What, no. Please--

#### TREXEL

See you tomorrow!

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

##### [sigh, dejected]

Just be-- be early! Oh.  Why does he get to go to all the parties?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sadness detected. Watch it, buster!
