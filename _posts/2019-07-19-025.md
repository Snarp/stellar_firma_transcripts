##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [alarm from last episode continues to blare]

#### DAVID

[__mimicking the alarm]__ Wee woo... wee woo... wee woo... wee woo... wee woo... wee woo... Are you gonna stop? IMOGEN, could you make it stop?

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

#### DAVID

##### [mimicking the alarm, more tired]

##### [sighs]

No, just more alarm.  Wee woo...  wee woo...

##### [footsteps approach, door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David.

#### DAVID

Wee-- Ah!

#### TREXEL

David, um. Hello.

#### DAVID [bitter]

*Trexel.*

#### TREXEL

Uh, David, I... *may*... have overreacted.

#### DAVID

Did you submit the brief?

#### TREXEL

Absolutely not.

#### DAVID

Why didn't you submit the brief?!

#### TREXEL

Because I was angry, David! You-- you had betrayed me! And don't let me-- I haven't forgotten that you--

#### DAVID

Is that why this alarm has been going off for the last *18 hours*?

#### TREXEL

Yes, that's the trial alarm. You're going to have a trial.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel stammers]

I'm going to have a *trial?*  Why am I gonna have a trial?!

#### TREXEL

Because we didn't submit a brief, David.

#### DAVID

Does everyone have a trial?

#### TREXEL

No, not everyone has a *trial--* look, let me-- let me break this down. Calm yourself. I'm gonna shut off the alarm, hang on.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

#### DAVID [softly]

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [soothing]

Here we go. Now, calm David. Soft David. Little David in a corner. There you go. Happy now?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, let's push on. Now, there has been a *distinct breach* of protocol, David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

A brief has not been submitted!

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

The reasons the brief has not been submitted--

#### DAVID

Because Trexel stole the brief.

#### TREXEL

Because David betrayed Trexel!

#### DAVID

Where is the brief, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

The brief is not important--

#### DAVID

Have you put it in a vent?

#### TREXEL

...No.

#### DAVID

Is it in a vent nest?

#### TREXEL

It may be in my vent nest, and I may have lost the vent nest. I went back to that place where there was lots of radiation, my *fingernails* came off, and I thought, "Let's not do this!" So it's somewhere in the vents. But irregardless, David, we missed the deadline. We missed the deadline *hours* ago, and I imagine that alarm's been going off the entire time I haven't been here, which can't have been nice. But that-- it's also not important right now. What's important is we've missed the deadline, and that is a big deal, David. Getting a bad planet? Planet that kills people? Sure! It's a headache for legal! People die, I'm a bit sad about that. But if you miss a deadline? Automatic trial. And not all clones get trials! Mostly, you just recycle them and move on.

#### DAVID [sarcastically]

I'm so lucky.

#### TREXEL

You're very lucky, David, and you should be thankful that you're gonna now have a trial, at the end of which--gonna admit--almost certainly gonna be recycled, but we have options, David.

#### DAVID [dryly]

What options, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I... will defend you. You're welcome. You are welcome.

#### DAVID

##### [immediately]

*You?* Can I defend myself??

#### TREXEL

No, absolutely not, you're a piece of property. I'm going to defend you, David, and that is-- well, I'm not gonna say I'm the *best* defence lawyer in the world, because that would be a lie. I've never done this before. But I'm pretty sure I'm pretty great, so I'm gonna give it a damn good go.

#### DAVID

Signs point to no.

#### TREXEL

Signs point... to fun! Come on, David, let's go to the trial room.

#### DAVID

Wait. I'm leaving? The room?

#### TREXEL

Yes! You can't have a trial in here, this is a consultancy room! Are we designing a trial? No, the trial was designed millennia ago!

#### DAVID

Right, I'm not gonna vaporize or burn up or, or anything if I leave this room?

#### TREXEL

No. It's just a door, David.

#### DAVID

Are you sure? I don't-- I've never been through a door before.

#### TREXEL

Come on.

#### DAVID

Does it hurt?

#### TREXEL

You can hold my hand if you want.

#### DAVID [pause]

I'll hold my own hand.

#### TREXEL

##### [talking to self]

Okay. I'm gonna hold *my* own hand as well. It sounds fun. Right. "Come on, Trexel, you can do this!" "Thank you, Trexel!"

#### DAVID

Why did your other hand say-- doesn't matter.

#### TREXEL

Okay, David, let us go. Haha!

#### DAVID

Open door...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

#### DAVID

Yes. I'm on this side of the door.

#### TREXEL

Come on, David. Follow me through the door.

#### DAVID

And the other side of the door is on the other side of the door.

#### TREXEL

Yes, come on David. Come out of the room--

#### DAVID

So, lifting up my foot...

#### TREXEL

--into the hallway!

#### DAVID

##### [foot hits ground]

Lifting up my foot... extending my foot... putting it down... on my side of the door.

#### TREXEL

You've just-- you've just-- you've just sort of stamped, David. That's just a stamping movement.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

I can't-- Well-- I just-- I'm trying...

#### TREXEL

Move the foot *forward*, David. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Forward.

#### DAVID

##### [very nervous]

Forward. And... down?

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

There it is!

#### DAVID [voice echoing]

Oh... oh... ooh...

#### TREXEL [voice echoing]

You've got a foot outside.

#### DAVID

And the other one...

#### TREXEL

Now bring that other little trotter out.

#### DAVID

Okay... ah...

#### TREXEL

##### [nervous David noises]

Come on. Hoofs away! And you're outside, David! You're outside! And b--

#### DAVID

##### [immediate panic]

...I'm outside! *Ooh*,it's so wide! Ooh! Oh! Where are the walls?! No!

#### TREXEL

Calm, David, calm!

#### DAVID

Where are the walls?!

#### TREXEL

Come here!

#### DAVID

Where are the walls?!

##### [David yelps as Trexel slaps him three times]

#### TREXEL

##### [David whimpers]

Calm down, Board damn you! This is just a hallway, David. Now, I know it's very long--

#### DAVID [hyperventilating]

But it goes-- it goes so-- it goes on forever!

#### TREXEL

It doesn't go on forever!

#### DAVID

Yes it does!

#### TREXEL

It just seems like that! David, you have to be calm. [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] You have to be calm.

#### DAVID

Okay-- I'm calm.

#### TREXEL

Calm.

#### DAVID

Calm!

#### TREXEL

Calm!

#### DAVID

I'm calm!

#### TREXEL

Calm!

#### DAVID

I'm calm!

#### TREXEL [yells]

*Calm*!

#### DAVID [screaming]

I'm *calm*! Oooh!

#### TREXEL

Lovely! Wonderful! This is progress, David. It's your first time out.

#### DAVID [breathy]

So calm...

#### TREXEL

So calm.

#### DAVID

So calm...

#### TREXEL

How are you feeling, David?

#### DAVID [extremely shaky]

*Very calm!*

#### TREXEL

I'm feeling pretty calm as well! Now come on, we've gotta make a little walk.

#### DAVID

Okay... walking. Yes. Right.

#### TREXEL

Now, David, you may find walking a little tricky, because--hand to Board--there *is*...a bit of a duty I have been neglecting. [__DAVID:__ What?] I was *supposed* to be exercising you around the room.

#### DAVID

*What?*

#### TREXEL

Because that means your legs probably have atrophied quite a bit while you've just been sitting in that chair for weeks and weeks. So you may have a little trouble walking.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, um...

#### TREXEL

Left, right, left, right.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel repeating after him]

##### [increasingly panicked]

Left. Right. Left... right... left... right...  left, right, left, right, *right, right, right, right!*--

#### TREXEL

No, left. No no, left! Left! Left-- argh!

##### [sounds of pain as David walks into wall]

#### DAVID

Ohh...

#### TREXEL

David, you've done a little bit of a semicircle into the wall and onto the floor there. Now, word of advice: if you don't go left, right, left, right... [__DAVID:__ Right.] I'll go right, left, right, left round to your behind and give you a kick in it!

#### DAVID

##### [takes a step]

##### [continues walking, Trexel hums]

##### [panicked]

Okay, right! No, I'm left-righting, right-lefting, right! Yep! Left, right, left, right, left... right! Okay, right... no, left. Uh, yes. Okay. Here I go.  Yes. Hmm... right. Room... 33. Room... 33? Room... 38? Wait, where did the other rooms go? Have we-- have we skipped in time? Or space?! Or something? What--

#### TREXEL

David, David, calm yourself down. We don't number things in a *linear* fashion here at Stellar Firma, [__DAVID:__ What?] and certainly not rooms. [__DAVID:__ What?] Weshift them around, we reuse them... after a while, everybody loses track.

#### DAVID

Wait. Am I actually the seventh David?

#### TREXEL

Mmm?

#### DAVID

The seventh David. I'm David 7, [__TREXEL:__ What?] that means I'm one, two, three, four, five, six-- David seven.

#### TREXEL

Could be. [__DAVID:__ What?] Don't know! Never checked.

#### DAVID

What? I don't-- I don't wanna come before David 32!

#### TREXEL

You could have. [__DAVID:__ Ahh!] Or you might've come after. Or maybe they never existed! [__DAVID:__ *What?!*] Or maybe they are right now. Maybe you are both!

#### DAVID

What?! No! I don't wanna be-- I'm David 7. I'm David 7... I'm David 7.

#### TREXEL

No, that seems ridiculous. That seems ridiculous. I wouldn't worry about it, David. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You know, a golden rule of surviving in Stellar Firma is don't worry about it because the answer's probably *terrifying!*

#### DAVID

Okay... I'm just, just gonna take a sit down on this bench. Here I go--

#### TREXEL

No, that's not a bench, David--

##### [sizzling noise, David screams]

#### TREXEL

Now, you've fallen foul of one of the early newbie mistakes of working at Stellar Firma: [__DAVID:__ Hot!] the heating ducts look like benches! That is just a piping hot area in order to heat the hallway in the darkness of space. They *have*, however, made them look a lot like a lovely, comfy bench.

#### DAVID [weakly]

Burnt through my onesie...

#### TREXEL

##### [David continues to moan in pain]

Have you burnt through your onesie?  You've only got one of those, David!

#### DAVID

I *know!* They're not-- the onesie...

#### TREXEL

Hang on, I've got some clone repair tape here.

#### DAVID

Okay, here we go. Right. Oh! Eeh!

##### [Tape is unrolled and patted onto David]

#### TREXEL

There we go. There it is...

#### DAVID [disturbed]

So sticky...

#### TREXEL

There it is. Now, that *will* bond entirely to your skin and become part of you, [__DAVID:__ What? No!] but it's the same color as your suit, so... who cares?

#### DAVID

Hooray...

#### TREXEL

Hooray. Come on.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Okay...

##### [footsteps continue]

#### TREXEL

Hmm.

#### DAVID

All the plants are dead...

#### TREXEL

Hmm?

#### DAVID

The plants. They're dead.

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes, they died years and years ago! I think it's actually impressive that they haven't turned into mush. Another wonderful achievement for the Stellar Firma Ltd. Bioengineering Environmental Division. Plants, although dead, do not rot.

#### DAVID

Good, yes, well done...

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

Now, people did say that will mess up the eco-cycle, because you need plants to rot in order to, to feed the new plants, but this way, the plants die and *nothing* else grows! There's poisoned earth!

#### DAVID

Okay, and we're through this... horrible dark bit.

##### [sound of lights flickering]

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes. The lights haven't worked here in quite a while. I'll tell you for why--they stopped working... Yes.

#### DAVID

O-okay, right, well, oh... onto the light, I guess? Um, where-- where is the justice room?

#### TREXEL

The what room?

#### DAVID

The justice room!

#### TREXEL

The where room?

#### DAVID

The justice room!

#### TREXEL

Where are we going?

#### DAVID

The room... for the justice??

#### TREXEL

No, I was-- I was following you!

#### DAVID

What? No! I don't know where I'm going, *you* know where I'm going!

#### TREXEL

*I* don't know where we're going!

#### DAVID [stammers]

Well, you have to know where we're going--

#### TREXEL

Hang on a minute.

#### DAVID

--otherwise how are we gonna get where we're going?!

#### TREXEL

##### [examines map briefly]

Hang on a minute. I've got a map here, I drew it at lunch. Hang on. Here we go. It *is* on a napkin from the Cosmic Lounge, so it has got quite a lot of vomit on it.Okay, this way. Come on, this way.

#### DAVID

Right, okay, okay, okay.

##### [light dripping noises]

#### DAVID

Oh, it's... Oh, it's all very wet down here. Ah, oh...

#### TREXEL

Oh, yeah-- don't step in those.

##### [more sizzling, David yells in pain]

#### TREXEL

Those-- that's not a water puddle, that's a battery acid puddle. I *am* taking us through an area marked as "Warning: Battery Acid".

#### DAVID

Oohh... oooohhhkay... ohh, just pick around that...

#### TREXEL

##### [slight Scottish accent]

I gave Harry a call about it a little while ago, and said, "Harry! There's battery acid in the hallways!" But he said,  "Oh, I can't help, Trexel. Stop calling me, Trexel!" Ahaha! What a guy.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, are we, are we close yet? I'm getting quite--

#### TREXEL

We are pretty close. Here it is.

#### DAVID

I've got another burn.

#### TREXEL

Just-- What have you got another burn on?

#### DAVID

My foot?

#### TREXEL

Oh, and the battery acid.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [stretches tape]

Hang on, I'll put clone tape around that. It won't help, but it'll make me feel better.

#### DAVID

No-- ah! Ooh! Oughh, so sticky...

#### TREXEL

Here we go! There it is. Don't try and pull that off because, as I say, it has bonded to your skin [__DAVID:__ Bonded to my skin, yeah.] and will just pull it away, and there'll just be *bone*, David! [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Nobody wants bo-- you know what? I don't know if clones *have* bones.

#### DAVID

I'm pretty sure I have bones.

#### TREXEL

Clone bones?

#### DAVID

Clone bones.

#### TREXEL

Are clone bones a thing?

#### DAVID

I think I've got clone bones.

#### TREXEL [disbelieving]

Okay... [__DAVID:__ Well, I'm--] Shall we find out? Should we break your leg [__DAVID:__ *No.*] and see if anything comes out?

#### DAVID

No, let's not.

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And here we are!

#### DAVID

##### [quietly]

Okay! In the... *Jhhstece* Room.

#### TREXEL

In the what now?

#### DAVID

In the *Jhhstece* Room.

#### TREXEL

David, I want you to think very carefully about something.

#### DAVID

But it's J, space, s, t, space, c, e. Room.

#### TREXEL

David, do you think it's a great idea, *just* as you're about to go on trial, to point out the fact that somebody has misspelled the word 'justice' on the door of the Justice Room? Do you think that the people listening--and don't get me wrong, David! There are *plenty* of people listening right now!--[__DAVID:__ What? Oh!] that* you*, just before your trial to see if you're going to *survive*, have chosen this time to be pedantic about the spelling of the word 'justice' on the door?

#### DAVID

...I don't know about you, but I read 'Justice Room' right here.

#### TREXEL

So do I!

#### DAVID

Good ol' justice... yep...

#### TREXEL

Look-- look at that interesting and creative spelling of 'justice'! What an intelligent person did that!

#### DAVID

Yes, um...

#### TREXEL

Justice room, indeed! [__DAVID:__ Justice room.] Come on inside, for some hot, fresh justice.

#### DAVID

Okay... here we go.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### DAVID

Oh, this looks a lot like the old office!

#### TREXEL

Yeah, nope, eh... all these rooms are pretty much the same except in this room is where the justice happens.

#### HARTRO

Ah, Trexel! David 7. Our trial. I always knew it would end like this... but I didn't think it would happen so soon. Especially after my team building! Did that not do a *thing* for you?

#### TREXEL

Well, I think it helped a little bit, but then you know, events somewhat--

#### HARTRO

You waste *everything* I do. Every good thing I've ever done you've wasted. Well, *I'm* prosecuting today, so get ready to feel the *wrath*.

#### TREXEL

I don't want to feel the wrath! David don't let her use the wrath!

#### DAVID

Trexel stole the brief!

#### TREXEL

Wh-- *betrayer*! How could you keep doing this?! I'm defending you, you--

#### DAVID

He-- he just took it! He took it from the room--

#### HARTRO

*Save it* for the trial.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [suspenseful trial music]

Trial initiated.  Please select justice mode.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, interesting.

#### DAVID

A good one.

#### IMOGEN

Show trial!

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### IMOGEN

Kangaroo court!

#### TREXEL

Fun!

#### IMOGEN

Trial by combat!

#### DAVID

No no no no.

#### IMOGEN

Trial by fire!

#### TREXEL

Interesting!

#### DAVID

Oh, no, no, no.

#### IMOGEN

Trial by bear!

#### TREXEL

Ha!

#### IMOGEN

The Harrowing!

#### HARTRO

Oh, yes.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Not that one.

#### IMOGEN

Fair trial!

#### TREXEL

##### [quietly]

Um... let's-- what should we go--? Uh--

#### DAVID [whispered]

Yes! That one, that one, that one, that one.

#### HARTRO

The Harrowing.

#### TREXEL

No-- fair trial, fair trial, please. We'd like a fair... trial.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Fair trial selected.

#### TREXEL

Nailed it! David, you are welcome. I am acing this lawyer thing.

#### HARTRO

That's not going to save you.

#### TREXEL

*I'm* going to save him. I'm going to save him with my mind!

#### HARTRO

There will be no saving today.

#### DAVID

Can I defend myself? Please?

#### TREXEL

David, please, this isn't about you. I'm going to use my big brain. My big, creative brain to save this innocent clone boy-- I'd like it on record that my client is innocent. Can I do that? Is that something I do-- objection! Overruled! The important thing is--

#### HARTRO

Simmer down, Trexel, we haven't even begun.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [suspenseful trial music]

Prosecution initiated.

#### HARTRO

We all know why we're here. A design brief deadline has been missed. Trexel Geistman. We all know he has some failings. He likes to drink moisturiser. [__TREXEL:__ Well, yes.] He is consistently late. [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] He has been hanging around in the ducts, don't ask me why. [__TREXEL:__ Well, it's quiet in there.] But this is not a trial for Trexel Geistman. No, this is a trial for Trexel Geistman's clone, David 7.

#### TREXEL

Yes, *that's* him! *That's* the clone right there! [__DAVID:__ You're my *defence!*]That's the one in the corner-- sorry?

#### HARTRO

Trexel--

#### DAVID [whispered]

You're my defence...

#### TREXEL

Oh, I [inaudible] about it.

#### HARTRO

*--pipe it*. The prosecution will show how David 7's failings have caused a design brief submission to be missed.

#### DAVID

*Trexel* stole the brief!

#### TREXEL

Well, I-- I-- you know-- Look, that's as... maybe, but I think Hartro will agree that any criticism of Stellar Firma Ltd.'s--

#### HARTRO

*Trexel*.

#### TREXEL

--bloodline based--

#### HARTRO

The less you say, the better. [__TREXEL:__ But I was going--] I am about to tell them why David 7 is at fault. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Can you just *pipe it?*

#### TREXEL

Look, I'm just trying to help.

#### HARTRO

A number of security alerts have been submitted from Trexel Geistman's office. I can only assume that David 7 had something to do with these. [__DAVID__: Wh--] The tubes in Trexel's office were found to be tampered with. Also, there is an audio blog on IMOGEN, and that is something [__DAVID:__ Uhhh...] that we all know at Stellar Firma clones should not be allowed to do.

#### TREXEL

An audio blog? I didn't know-- An audio blog?

#### DAVID

Uhhh...

#### HARTRO

You don't know everything, do you, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Wh-- but David, an audio blog?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

...David, this is a trial, and they've just accused you of having an audio blog.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Do we have a clip of the audio blog?

#### HARTRO

Yes, we do.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Audio initiating!

#### DAVID [recorded]

##### [singing badly]

##### [recording cuts off]

Hello. And welcome to...  â™ª David's... Fact Corner! Where I'm... David 7! With facts! â™« The... number one and... only, um, audio blog from...  me, David 7, where I... Da-- David 7, bring you... facts! N-not about David 7. About other-- other things. Uh--

#### TREXEL

David?

#### DAVID

That wasn't me.

#### TREXEL

##### [David makes noises of muffled consternation]

David, that was entirely inappropriate! Clones aren't allowed audio blogs! He's just shaking his head-- just shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders. I don't like this David 7 character. I know-- Wait a minute, hang on a second, he is an innocent clone boy. Continue.

#### HARTRO

Can the court show that David 7 was nodding his head that that was his voice?

#### DAVID

No! No I wasn't.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Nod recorded.

#### HARTRO

And the tubes in Trexel's office. David 7, can you explain how those were found tampered with?

#### TREXEL [stammers]

Your Honour, I would like to request a writ of silent judgment! By which I can silently judge David and then tell everybody what his answers are.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Silent judgment rejected.

#### TREXEL

Ok, worth a go. Okay, David, off you go. Don't incriminate yourself just because you did it. Right, off you go.

#### DAVID

I *didn't* do it.

#### TREXEL

Ok, yeah, well that's as-- maybe. I don't think anyone really believes that but give it a go.

#### DAVID

I-I didn't-- I didn't! I didn't. I didn't. I didn't. I didn't-- tubes? I don't know what a tube is. I've never seen a tube in my life.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Guilty plea recorded!

#### DAVID

Wha-- tha--! Oh...

#### TREXEL

Did you-- did you just plead guilty, David?!

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

It sounded like you pleaded guilty! It was registered as guilty!

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Wha-- I didn't! I didn--

#### TREXEL

Just stop talking! You're-- you're a hot mess, David, you're a hot mess!

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### HARTRO

To be honest, it doesn't really matter what David 7 says. This is all just for show and we need to carry on and this is very inconvenient, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I think we selected "fair trial", Hartro. We selected the fair trial.

#### DAVID

We did select fair trial.

#### HARTRO

The Harrowing would have been much quicker.

#### TREXEL

Well, yes, it would have been much quicker but it would be messier as well.

#### DAVID

I don't want to be *Harrowed!*

#### HARTRO

While, David 7, there have also been a number of security alerts. Would you like to speak anything about that?

#### TREXEL

Yes, security alerts, David. What do you think of those?

#### DAVID

Uh, Trexel spends a lot of time sad, and that... sets off a security alert.

#### TREXEL

I also had that fish one time.

#### HARTRO

I'm not buying-- oh-- *fish?*

#### TREXEL

Yes, I had a fish.

#### HARTRO

You had fish in the office?

#### TREXEL

I have a fish right now! Hang on, I'll just get it.

#### HARTRO

*Do not* take out the fish, Trexel--

##### [fish slapping sounds]

#### TREXEL

There it is! There it is!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Fish detected! Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Fine, fine sea bass. Look at it then. Yes...

#### DAVID

See? It's Trexel's security alerts! I have nothing to do with this!

#### TREXEL

A fine bass. A fine, fine bass. Look at it there. Look at the lines, sultry lines...

#### HARTRO

So, David 7, you *do* admit that there were fish in the office?

#### TREXEL

Kiss me, you fool.

#### HARTRO

In the-- in the design room, there were fish.

#### DAVID

He's licking that fish!

#### TREXEL

##### [puts fish back in the bag]

Oh yes... whoa, hey! Hoo now, this is for private time. Just gonna pop the fish back in there.

#### DAVID

Look-- but-- the number of security alerts that come from Trexel's office probably haven't significantly increased while *I've* been there.

#### TREXEL

Good point. Let's check the statistics. How many were there before David and how many are there after?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

#### HARTRO

There were 117 before David--

#### TREXEL

The week before. Okay. Week after?

#### HARTO

--and, uh, 390.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that *is* more, David. That is more.

#### DAVID

Oh... um...

#### HARTRO

That's significantly more. So--

#### TREXEL

That is more. How do you plead, you guilty fool?! Hang on a second. Hang on. Wind that back a little bit. How do you plead, you innocent fiend?!

#### DAVID

I-innocently?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Lie detected!

#### TREXEL

Ah, David, you're *really* bad at this! [__DAVID:__ Ohh...] Hang on. Let's just test something. Say you're innocent, David?

#### DAVID

I'm innocent.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Lie detected!

#### TREXEL

Well, y'know, I'm gonna do my best, David, but it's stacking up against us! This is a fair trial we selected.

#### DAVID

Oh. Oh... I'm David 7?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

...Truth acknowledged!

#### TREXEL

There we go. [__DAVID: [disappointed]__ Oh, okay.] Well, at least that's true! At least that's true.

#### HARTRO

##### [David stutters]

I would *also* like to add that there was a time, David 7, when you tried to give me clone slurry.

#### TREXEL

##### [David continues to stutter]

That is assault.

#### HARTRO

That is an assault on a line manager.

#### DAVID

I-- I-- I can only *give* you-- you wha-- I just-- you wanted to get slurry--

#### TREXEL

Listen to him. Listen to him blabber.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

I could only-- clone slurry--

#### TREXEL

That's the blabbering of the innocent, in my opinion.

#### DAVID

I can't-- it shocked--

#### HARTRO

And stop there. I'd also like to add:David 7 is sassy. He's a clone, and clones should not be sassy.

#### TREXEL

It's true, you are a sassy, sassy boy, David.

#### DAVID

No I'm not.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sass detected! Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

There you go.

#### HARTRO

I rest my case.

#### TREXEL

Damned from his own innocent mouth!

#### HARTRO

And it is for these reasons that the prosecution recommends that David 7 be recycled without any delay.

#### TREXEL

That's-- that's pretty, pretty convincing. I know if I was a judge, I'd be blending you right now. But I'm not! I'm a defence lawyer so best of luck to me!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [suspenseful trial music]

Defence initiated.

#### TREXEL

##### [talking to self]

My turn! My turn! Ooh, I love this bit. Okay, hang on, let me just get into the zone. Right, okay. Justice... justice well. Get a bucket of truth, dip it in the justice well! Pull it up! It takes a long time, because justice is hard but here it is! The weight in your arms pours you into a cup of integrity. Take a sip--

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Sorr--What?

#### DAVID

Please take the wig off.

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

Hang on a second! Take a sip-- mm, that's sweet, sweet justice. Throw it in the face of lies! Oh, sorry David, sorry. I didn't mean to throw-- although you *are* full of lies...

#### DAVID

Please, please take the curly wig off!

#### TREXEL

Well I like the curly wig. I think--

#### HARTRO

And could you please put the fish down?

##### [fish sounds resume]

#### TREXEL

##### [to Hartro]

Fine, okay, fine. Just pop that back in there. I'll deal with you... later. I intend to prove today, to you-- the assembled people and clones and AI matrices, which-- might I say, are sounding particularly sultry today! Did you defrag your core, IMOGEN?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Flattery rejected! Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

##### [paper rustles]

Worth. A. Go. But we have all gathered to find the truth. What is truth? That's an interesting question. I have a flip chart. Can I get the flip chart out?

#### HARTRO

Oh, Trexel, this is such a waste of time!

#### TREXEL

##### [throws away chart]

Okay, well then, we won't use the flip chart!  I don't need it. Truth doesn't need a flip chart. It just needs a keen mind, a wide mouth! Big, hairy hands! Big th--

##### [fish noises resume]

#### HARTRO

*Put the fish down.*

#### TREXEL

Okay, I'll just pop that back in there. I'll deal with you... justice. Now, I understand David 7 looks guilty. Because of his guilt, for one? Sure. Because of the fact that he has wide, terrified eyes, the eyes of the guilty, but if you look deep into those eyes, you'll see a tiny little barcode in there because that's how we tell clones apart when we want to do that. And if you scan that barcode you know what it says? Clone. And who among us hasn't been a clone at one time in our life or other-- I know I haven't! Neither has Hartro. It's only David. I'm not sure what point I'm making, but the *important* thing... is that David is *guilty* and should be *recycled--* hang on.

#### HARTRO

Can we please initiate the Harrowing? Please.

#### TREXEL

No, no we can't initiate the Harrowing!

#### DAVID

No! Please don't Harrow me!

#### TREXEL

Okay, hang on, let-- I can do this. I can do this. David 7. Thief? Who can say. That's not what we're talking about here, but think about it! Look at his shifty eyes. I intend to prove here today, now, in this time, in this second-- well, that second's gone. But we're gonna come back round to that second because the universe is infinite and sort of a, a closed circle, so eventually everything will come back 'round. So-- so-- what does any of this really matter, if you think about it? Uh-huh? Uh-huh? IMOGEN? Does any of this really matter?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sophistry detected. Security alerted!

#### TREXEL

This keeps happening. This keeps happening. What is it-- why have security never turned up? I keep on alerting them and they never turn up. Am I not important enough? I--I demand a trial for security because security are the *real* ones that--

#### HARTRO [gritted teeth]

*Oh my Board*, Trexel, can you just shut your trap for one second?! We've come to the end of the line! We are at a trial! David 7 is here. He is about to be recycled! Just. Shut. Your mouth.

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro shushes]

Can I--  Can I finish my case?

#### HARTRO

Shut! Your mouth.

#### TREXEL

I just want-- closing statement--

#### HARTRO

Shut it now or I'll put a foot in it.

#### TREXEL

I... I do not accept trial by foot. I will... rest my defence. In saying--!

#### HARTRO

And rest.

#### TREXEL

In saying! David 7.

#### DAVID [tiredly]

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Sweet, innocent thief David 7 [__DAVID:__ *No*.] is not guilty of this particular crime, but I'd keep an eye on him! Because, you know, [__DAVID: [resigned]__ I'll take it. I'll take it.] there's no smoke without fire. Mm-hmm. Okay. The defence rests.

##### [suspenseful trial music]

#### HARTRO

In closing, I think it's worth mentioning, obviously Trexel is not the one on trial here.

#### TREXEL

No justice! No justice for Trexel.

#### HARTRO

Yes. It's David 7 that we're here for today. But let us find out more about Trexel Geistman. The man, the myth, the shuttle crash.

#### TREXEL

I crashed *one* shuttle.

#### HARTRO

The planet destroyer.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that happened a few times.

#### HARTRO

Who is he?

#### TREXEL

Who am I? Who are we asking?

#### HARTRO

I have a collection of voice clips that I will play now, if the court approves.

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Please! I would love to hear what people think of me.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Surprise evidence approved! Audio initiating.

##### [Stellar Firma theme plays]

#### WITNESS 1

Trexel Geistman? Well, I've-- I've got nothing against him personally, but, uh... he did leave me to die on that asteroid that time.

#### WITNESS 2

He's the reason I only have one eye, you know.

#### WITNESS 3

A planet he designed traveled itself back in time and affected my home world's orbit! Now I'm stuck in a time paradox and now my body's evolved all weird...

#### WITNESS 4

Trexel Geistman. If ever I come across him again, I will do to him what he did to my space tug.

#### DAVID [recorded]

Well, he's always late, and honestly quite abusive, and he's-- he's just a terrible planet designer! He's just-- he's just really, really bad. Uh-- anyway, what is this for?

#### TREXEL

David, how could you?

#### TREXEL [recorded]

Well, I would describe myself as a sort of a-- a design maverick and a liar! An absolute liar! I should know, because I'm lying right now. Or am I? Ha ha, gotcha. Or did I? I'm in a bush. Anyway, what's this for?

##### [recording clicks off, music stops]

#### HARTRO

And after hearing what we've all heard now, we have to ask ourselves, can we really trust Trexel Geistman? When he says David 7 is innocent, well, we know that just simply is not true. In fact, often the *opposite* of what Trexel Geistman says is, indeed, true. Trexel Geistman's words... not equal to true. I rest my case.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Character assassination approved!

#### TREXEL

Oh come on, we selected fair!May I say one final thing in closing before sentencing?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Final desperate plea approved!

#### TREXEL

Thank you, IMOGEN. Thank you. We've all heard a lot today and... I might not know a lot about justice but I know one thing: I'm Trexel Geistman. Not your big-city Stellar Firma centrally-approved attorney-lawyer-person-thing. But I know a thing or two about *home* truths. The truths that *really cut deep*.

I know when I look out at this courtroom at these angry, angry faces, at the sweating clone here, there is something that really hits home. The old ways are the best. Ignore your problems. Move on! Don't-- don't-- don't overanalyse stuff! Think about-- think about the little guy. The small businessperson. The microscopic germ that's been defrauded of their savings. That's who we really need to focus on.

Because if there's one thing I know, and I'm aware that's three things now, but if there's one thing that I know? It's that justice is a dish best served tepid. Not too hot! You'll burn your mouth, and then the skin will come away. But not too cold. Cold justice? What's that? That sounds like a bad procedural. "I'm Justin Cold Justice, attorney of death!"

But the important thing is, and I should know a thing or two about things, because I am one... I think we're all things here. I'm a thing, you're a thing. IMOGEN, sort of a thing. So aren't we all just things together, in this crazy mixed-up world?

#### HARTRO

Is this going anywhere?

#### TREXEL

To sum up! The justice that must be served today is a justice of a temperature of our own choosing. When we look back on this date, years from now, we want to think, "Yes, that was some lukewarm justice that was served that day." And I spoon it into my mouth. And I spoon it into the mouth of my friends! And my friends turned to me and said, "You're invited to a dinner party, Trexel. You *don't* have to break in through an air vent! You're invited and there's a chair for you, and you don't have to push Jackson off his chair to get in!"

...So in closing, if justice is to be served here today... and if justice is to be observed here today, not running behind a bush, but in plain sight with a strong light shined on it so justice goes, "*Whoa!* What's that light all about?", that we need to accept one home truth. Back home, where we all live at home. That without David 7, I am a lesser consultant. No other consultant has loved a clone more than me, and no other clone has survived longer in my care than David 7. And on that fact alone, and with that one point, and with that one home truth, living in your house, eating stuff out of your fridge-- you *must* agree! You *cannot* reject the fact that I *love* him! ...Love is strong. I *like* him... quite a bit. The defence rests.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Plea accepted... Guilty.

##### [suspenseful trial music]

#### TREXEL

##### [heated]

*Damn it, damn it, damn it!*

#### DAVID

Oh, dear.

#### TREXEL

I thought I did a really good job!

#### DAVID

No, you didn't. You did a terrible job.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

You're guilty, David! [__DAVID:__ Well--] Fine, fine. I didn't want to have to do this, but there is one way out of this *hot mess* of your own creation, David. The employee handbook! __[brandishes handbook, gasps] "__Oh, gosh, what's he got there? Oh, I didn't think he would-- he's a small town country lawyer. Oh my gosh, what's he gonna--"

#### DAVID

*Trexel.*

#### TREXEL

##### [flips open book]

Sorry, sorry. Sorry! Sorry.  David 7 is property of Stellar Firma, and I, Trexel Geistman, am acting *in loco parentis* of that property. *Vis a vie, avec moi*, he is my property. We all agree? Yes we do.

#### HARTRO

What are you doing? Trexel, what are you doing?

#### TREXEL

##### [gasp]

A ha! I am-- I am justicing, right here, right now. Give me a-- give me a little bit of arm room for my justice. *So*, if Trexel Geistman owns David 7, then under the trading statutes of the Employee Handbook, Section Y6354, paragraph 478, sentence K: "*In cases of property confiscation and destruction, a* Consultant"-- that's me-- "*has the right to invoke swapsies*." Swapsies, gasp! Gasps around the courtroom. "Swapsies."

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL "

##### [stone cold silence]

Oh, what's swapsies? I hope he explains it." [__DAVID:__ *Trexel!*] He's gonna explain it! I may switch out property of equal value to be confiscated in place of the property originally proposed. As such, I, Trexel Geistman, am giving up my privileges and employee access to the Cosmic Lounge. Audible gasps. Audible gasps from everyone.

#### HARTRO

This is ridiculous.

#### TREXEL

##### [shaky breath]

And it is with great personal sacrifice that I, Trexel KGK Geistman, do hand in my employee access card to the Cosmic Lounge, and in so doing, save the sweet clone life...  of David 7.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Swapsies requested! Evaluating submission.

#### TREXEL [muttered]

Please, come on, please.

#### IMOGEN

Submission granted!

#### DAVID

Really?

#### IMOGEN

David 7 swapsied!

#### TREXEL

Yes!!

#### DAVID

Yes!! Swapsied!

#### IMOGEN

Please submit employee access card for recycling.

#### TREXEL

##### [sounds of card being shredded]

Ahh... Oh, there she goes!

#### HARTRO

This is such a sham.

#### TREXEL

Shine on, you crazy access card...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Trial concluded.

##### [suspenseful trial music]

#### HARTRO [angrily]

Well, that was a waste of time. Trexel-- Augh! That's it. I have an appointment, I'm off. I'm going to be keeping my eyes on you, Trexel, so don't. Screw. Up.

#### TREXEL [smugly]

Bye, Hartro. See you next week.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

We did it, David. We did it as a team.

#### DAVID

Trexel--

#### TREXEL

A team that I led and beautifully executed.

#### DAVID

Could you have always swapsied?

#### TREXEL

Beg your pardon?

#### DAVID

Could you have always done swapsies?

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes, absolutely. That was always an option.

#### DAVID [furious]

And you knew about it from the start?!

#### TREXEL

Well, I wanted to have a go at the trial, David. I've never had a go at a trial! Would you-- would you-- would you take from me the pleasure of doing a speech at a trial? That's-- that's the top, David. That's the pinnacle of Geistman!

#### DAVID

I thought I was gonna be *recycled!*

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs and whimpers]

Well, we all have, you know, woes and worries,  and I don't think you should make this all about you. You're been quite selfish, David. I saved your life! Eventually!

#### DAVID

Yes, okay, you did, and I appreciate it. I know the Cosmic Lounge was important to you, and you're not gonna be able to see Harry anymore, so [__TREXEL:__ Well... I mean...] thank you.

#### TREXEL

That's not *entirely* true, I mean, I'll just go to the Astral Bar with him.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

The Astral Bar. It's next door. It's actually a little bit nicer than the Cosmic Lounge, but you know, it hasn't got as good pool tables so I don't normally go there. But Harry will be down there already. In fact, I'll pop off at the moment!

#### DAVID [furious]

*Trexel!!! Right, that's it*!

##### [voices become tinny, as if being heard through recording]

#### DAVID [screams]

Come here and gimme that fish! G-give it!

##### [sounds of struggle, David beating Trexel over the head with fish]

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

Get off that. That's mine!Hartro! Save me, Hartro! He's gone mad! He's a guilty clone, blend him! Blend him!* Blend him!*

##### [fish slaps continue]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Fish detected! Security alerted.

#### NUMBER 1

Well, well, well... who would've thought it of old Geistman?No matter. Number 48?

#### NUMBER 48

Yes, Number 1?

#### NUMBER 1

##### [ominously]

I think we will be taking a... very close interest in David 7 from now on.

#### NUMBER 48

What?

#### NUMBER 1

I said I think that we and David 7 are going to be crossing paths again. Presently.

#### NUMBER 48

Well, what does that mean?

#### NUMBER 1

It means that-- it means that David 7 will be hearing from us soon. Very soon.

#### NUMBER 48

See, this is exactly it! This is what I've been talking about! Clear communication in the workplace. Congratulations, you sound very impressive and scary, but I haven't got a damn clue what to do with it! Are we killing David 7? Are we kidnapping him? Sending him a threatening note?

#### NUMBER 1

No, that's not what I mean--

#### NUMBER 48

You *always* do this. Always with the ominous tone. You're not impressing anyone. This is exactly what Dr. Kroll was talking about, communication is key. Clear communication. You don't listen. You never listen.
