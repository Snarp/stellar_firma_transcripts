#### ALEX

Hey everyone, Alex here with a quick note ahead of today's episode. As part of our efforts to make sure that we get through every outstanding Patreon shout out, we're increasing the number of people we thank. This means we're gonna move the shout outs to the end of episodes going forwards so as not to make people wait extra long before the start of a show. That's all for now. Thanks for your patience and we hope you enjoy today's episode.

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Jasper. May you always stay up long past your bedtime.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [David breathing evenly but angrily]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Clone temperature still critical.

##### [footsteps approach, door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

##### [David growls angrily]

##### [David continues to growl]

Good after-- Oh! Hey. Ooh. Ah. David--David you seem a little-- Still? Has this been--  Okay. Okay. Okay, David. David, David, David. David? David, I'm just gonna, just let's all calm down. Let's just take a-- Imagine I've got a big blanket  and the blanket's made of calm and I'm just carefully throwing it over you.

##### [David exhales angrily]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Blankets make things hotter.

#### TREXEL

##### [David growls]

##### [stammers]

##### [fabric rustles]

Okay, the blanket's slid and not really worked. Okay, well, David, I've, I've got a solution to this because clearly you're *very* upset for some... reason.  And  I think there is a way, there is a way we can solve this. I've invited a mediator. [__DAVID:__ Huh?] Please welcome... mediator extraordinaire, Clytemnestra Cairn.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### DAVID

What?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Hello.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Mediator detected. Security open to compromise.

#### DAVID

Another one of your friends.

#### TREXEL

A f-friend? No, a work colleague.

#### DAVID

And exactly in which... bar did he meet you?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Uh, actually I was hired to come here. [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] I've been formally requested to attend this session of whatever it is that you two are up to and, uh, I'd like to help.

#### DAVID

##### [uncertain]

Right.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I see that there are some problems and I think I can help you.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. You see?

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I have paid for a mediator because I care, David.

#### DAVID

##### [sassy]

Oh, you get paid.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I get paid. Don't you get paid?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I also get paid.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

We all get pa--  Clone. It's a clone.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Aah! You see--

#### TREXEL

It's a clone.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, I understand.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

Clones don't get paid because clones are-- Yeah.

##### [Clytemnestra laughs]

#### DAVID

Yeah. It-- it's me, David 7, sentient filth, the clone!

#### TREXEL

Okay. This, this is the behaviour I was talking about, Clytemnestra.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Mm.

#### DAVID

Oh sorry, my "behaviour". Oh, do I have bad "behaviour". Hmm? Hmm?!

#### TREXEL

You see? See?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Case in point.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [Trexel breathes in]

##### [Trexel exhales deeply through his mouth, David startles]

I think everything's getting a little bit tense. Why don't we just take one minute to breathe in through our nose  and out through the mouth. Do you have a nose and mouth?

#### DAVID

...Um...

#### TREXEL

Good question, David. Answer her.

#### DAVID

They... Look... Face... No?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

There are two gaping holes on your face, I can only assume are the places in which you breathe and speak.

#### DAVID

Rude!

#### TREXEL

You see, see, he's always very objectionable.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Gosh.

#### TREXEL

You ask a simple question--

#### DAVID

Well, hang on a minute.

#### TREXEL

You ask a simple question like, "Do you have a nose and a mouth?" Anybody-- anybody--

#### DAVID

My face is being judged!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Terribly aggressive.

#### TREXEL

Very aggressive.

#### DAVID

You-- you came into my office and judged my face!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Not your office.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Well, I'm here to settle some of these issues that you two may be having. I can see that you two have a lot of history and a lot of baggage. So, I would like for you to talk to each other about why it is you became friends and/or colleagues in the first place.

#### TREXEL

I can field this--

#### DAVID

Oh, no I can start this.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Oh, oh--

#### DAVID

Um, so I was--

#### TREXEL

Sorry, sorry. After you, David. You see?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Ah! Good Trexel.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You are not supposed to try and win a mediation.

#### DAVID

Um, I was created in a jar and then funneled into the office and then Trexel turned up and has made my life a living hell.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh.

#### TREXEL

That scans. That's about right.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Hmm. And you, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Um, I walked in, he was there.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

A tale as old as time.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Okay. Uh, I can see that this is going to be an interesting afternoon.

#### TREXEL

Should we, should we perhaps just, you know, continue on with our workday as we would?

#### DAVID

Yeah. Oh yeah, we have work.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Yes. How about you continue on with your working day, just as normal. [__DAVID:__ Oh yeah, no.] Just pretend I'm not even here.

#### DAVID

Oh, yeah yeah yeah, actually. No, yeah. Another problem, another problem if you want to know, you don't want to know. Right, this shift - eight hours. Do you know how long we have to the end of the shift? About twenty minutes. Hmm.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Hmm. Oh.

#### DAVID

Every day!

#### TREXEL

I feel--

#### DAVID

Every day!

#### TREXEL

--that the best way to work is under constraints, so I don't turn up at the start of a workday. I really skip it at the end, normally with a friend, and just see what happens.

#### DAVID

Alright, fine. Well, let's just do a *normal* workday then.

#### TREXEL

Yes, let's do a *normal working day*.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I'll just-- Don't--

#### DAVID

Shall I get-- I'll read the case that we have with twenty minutes to go.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Don't pretend-- Just pretend I'm not even here.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I'll just sit back-- I'll observe with my notebook over here.

#### TREXEL

David, if you wouldn't mind.

#### DAVID

Fine. Okay.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initiating.

##### [pneumatic tube seal breaks, closes tube door]

#### DAVID

The next thing we need to expedite is from Axel Nee Juul.

#### TREXEL

Mm.

#### DAVID

Pronouns: he/him. Uh, the department is Legal - Blame Deflection and Excuses.

#### TREXEL

Ah! Tricky crowd. When you get involved in Legal and you're not a Legalese, you'll end up being some sort of Legal Weevil and somebody will step on you! Squish!

#### DAVID

##### [not amused]

May I continue?

#### TREXEL

I would *love it* if you would.

#### DAVID

Hmm. Their role is Lead Creative Writer. [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] And their problem: Board help us. Our reinforced office door has been melted off by a solar flare and now we are... beset on all sides by rabid prosecutors.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

The prosecutors come.

#### DAVID

Oh, this one looked like quite urgent. If only we'd been here 7 1/2 hours ago to deal with it.

#### TREXEL

Look, those doors are pretty thick so even if it's been--

#### DAVID

It's already been melted off by a solar flare.

#### TREXEL

Entirely melted off?

#### DAVID

Very specifically. They're beset on all sides by rabid prosecutors.

#### TREXEL

So they're, they're like sort of, you know, "circle the wagons" style defence ring--

#### DAVID

I don't know.

#### TREXEL

--the Legal team versus the prosecutors.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

##### [crosstalk]

Do you know-- do you know what's probably going to happen? Right, they've already just been completely killed by all the prosecutors.  Because somebody's 7 1/2 hours late. Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Hmm!

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

You see! You see! This is what I'm talking about! This is what I'm talking about! Oh, let's not bother because everything's already ruined because of Trexel.

#### DAVID

I'm the only one who tries to bother about anything ever!

#### TREXEL

Clytemnestra, help us. I can't even work with him! You see, you see he's emotional, he's angry. Apparently I've already ruined everything even before we started!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [David starts laughing uncontrollably]

Well, it does seem that he's being quite reasonable in some of his requests. And it seems that perhaps  you, Trexel, might be the unreasonable one in this situation.

##### [David's laughing gets louder]

#### TREXEL

Um... um... um...

#### DAVID

J'accuse!

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

J'refuse!

#### DAVID

J'disabuse-you-of-this-notion!

#### TREXEL

J'I-am-rubber j'you-are-glue, bounce off of me and on to you!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [chairs scoot on floor]

Okay everyone. I see that there's some sort of imbalance here. Um, how about we, uh, all of us stand up.  Everyone stand up together.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [Trexel and David make body shaking noises]

And let's, uh, let's shake off all of our worries.  Let's shake them all out. Let's shake all of our bodies and all of our bits of extra bits that are attached to us.

##### [objects start falling onto the floor]

#### TREXEL

Okay. Lots of things are falling out of my pockets.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [noises stop]

And... stop!  There we go. Um, if you want to pick up all of your various, uh, [__TREXEL:__ What's that?] detritus [__DAVID:__ It's all--] that have fallen out on the floor. Nuts, bolts, cigarette lighters--

#### TREXEL

That's where that went! That's evidence.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

--drugs. Fantastic.

#### DAVID

##### [splash]

Oh! Oh, I'm dry again. Oh, no! Ah-- ooh-- Puddle!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

How do we feel now?

#### TREXEL

Kind of loose and shaky.

#### DAVID

Moist again.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Do you feel in any way calmer?

#### TREXEL

I do feel a little calmer.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Yes.

#### DAVID

My neck hurts.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

That's the magic of shaking your body. Do you want to watch me shake my body?

#### TREXEL

I mean, we-- we've already--

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [begins shaking her body]

Oh, off I go! Oh!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh! Oh, this does feel good! Oh!

#### TREXEL

Okay, is this for us or you?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

This is just for me!

#### TREXEL

Just for Clytemnestra!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, feels absolutely marvelous! I might continue to do this while you're talking!

#### DAVID

Shall I just--?

#### TREXEL

It's very distracting.

#### DAVID

Shall I stay in the puddle or...?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

All the shaking is starting to get weird!

##### [Clytemnestra continues shaking]

#### TREXEL

Uh, David, I-- she's just shaking, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] so I think if we just, just plow on.

#### DAVID

Plow on with what? The completely, definitely dead Legal team?

#### TREXEL

Well, why don't we just give it a *try*?

#### DAVID

Oh, yeah, let's just, let's just pretend! Let's just pretend that it's all fine and that what we're doing hasn't already been completely muffed up by you!

#### TREXEL

Things have been muffed up by me?

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

I think your attitude's muffing it up.

#### DAVID

No, I think your lateness is *muffing* it up.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

What do you want me to do about it?

#### DAVID

It's pre-muffed! We can't unmuff it 'cause you've already muffed it.

#### TREXEL

Well if it's all pre-muffed why don't we just tear it up and all go home?

__[sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone__ __beeping, Clytemnestra stops shaking]__

#### TREXEL

Woah! Okay! Okay, 'cause the gun walls [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] don't care for that. We're going to complete the shift.

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

We're gonna complete the shift. Uh, Clytemnestra, that happens a lot here. Is that bad?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Um... no. I think you should just carry on and smile through it.

#### TREXEL

Smile through.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Guns come from the walls; you smile through.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Smile!

#### TREXEL

##### [smiling]

Smile through.

#### DAVID

##### [smiling with performative cheerfulness]

Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Just smile.

#### DAVID

Here's me smiling!

#### TREXEL

We're all smiling now!

#### DAVID

All good!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, what beautiful, terrifying smiles you both have.

#### DAVID

I am so glad that Trexel is here to help with this expediting job.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, David.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

That's good, David 7! Fantastic!

#### DAVID

Brilliant.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

And you Trexel? Might you say something kind about David 7?

##### [beat]

##### [Trexel attempts to find the words but can't find them]

#### DAVID

This has happened before.

#### TREXEL

No. No. No. I'm working up to it!

#### DAVID

Hartro has tried to--

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Hang on. Wait, wait. Let him--

#### TREXEL

I'm working up to it. I'm working up to it. David 7...

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, he's, he's sort of doing a revving motion like he's starting an old lawn mower.

#### TREXEL

##### [quickly]

David 7-- Wooh! David 7-- Yeeh!  David 7 is sometimes helpful!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

What a towering achievement.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

I did-- I did it! I landed it!

#### DAVID

##### [neutral]

Wow.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

How did that feel, David 7?

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Slightly below average.

#### TREXEL

##### [Clytemnestra gasps]

David 7 is a good companion.  I'm getting into it now. David 7 is somebody I like to spend time with.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, a breakthrough.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

David 7 is somebody I... re-speeeeee--Ah!--can-ta.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

You can do it, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Not quite there. I don't think I'm quite there.

#### DAVID

##### [annoyed]

Okay, but also you are only doing this because you think you're winning at somebody not because you genuinely feel these things.

#### TREXEL

You can't prove anything.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You can ruin anything by over analysing it.

#### DAVID

I think I rest my case!

#### TREXEL

I--

#### DAVID

J'accuse!

#### TREXEL

I-- I re-excite the case to allow for further arguments and my argument is j'refuse!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Right. Boys, why don't we continue with the work, because right now I haven't got a lot of things to go on just a lot of shouting. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] So, I'd like to continue observing you if possible.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, fine. Fine.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Thank you.

##### [David sighs]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

I can guarantee there will be much more shouting.

#### DAVID

Alright, yeah. Yeah, let's-- let's pretend that the Legal team is not all completely dead.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay, so "Oh no! Oh no, the door's been blown off by a solar flare and there's rabid prosecutors everywhere. [__TREXEL:__ First--] What are we gonna do, Trexel?"

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

First and foremost, we've got station security systems. We've got enough gun walls in here. Why aren't there gun walls in there to take out the prosecutors, rabid or otherwise? Stellar Firma is not a fan of the prosecutor. We're normally on the defence side of a case  because people have died. Um, so I don't think that Stellar Firma is gonna be like, "Oh look, prosecutors. That's fine." So surely the defences will kick in. [__DAVID:__ Okay, so you are arguing--] And IMOGEN will be like, "Pow! Pow! Take that! Pow!" "Oh, I'm bleeding to death. I had a family! I had a family and I'll never see them again!" You know, that sort of stuff.

#### DAVID

So your argument is that the problem has already been solved because they put defences in place and so we don't need to do anything.

#### TREXEL

Well no, I'm saying that that is something you should consider.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You know, people sometimes complain when there isn't anything wrong.

#### DAVID

Um, alright.

#### TREXEL

Check-- check it!

#### TREXEL

##### [reading what's being written]

I'll-- I'll just, I'll write it on the suggestion.  It's all in your head--

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

No! No!  David, I'm asking you to check it.

#### DAVID

Check-- check what?

#### TREXEL

Check the status.

#### DAVID

What, on IMOGEN?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

##### [groans softly]

Well, I've got--

#### TREXEL

Oh-- Oh, no. Okay, fine. [__DAVID:__ Fine.] If you've got problems, I'll do it. I'll do it perhaps.

#### DAVID

##### [snarky]

Yeah, fine.  Oh yeah, you look up anything on IMOGEN up for the first time ever.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, gosh. That's a t-terribly kind offer of you, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

##### [with feeling]

Thank you, Clytemnestra.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

You see? I'll do it for you.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

It might do you well to say the same thing, David 7.

#### DAVID

But it's not. It's like the base function of his job!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [basically a threat]

Say it, David 7.

#### DAVID

What-- Um...

#### TREXEL

Oh, gosh.

#### DAVID

##### [nervous]

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Uh, David-- I'd say it, David.

#### DAVID

##### [nervous stuttering]

Th-thank, thank, thank you, Tr-Trexel. That's, uh, very k-kind thing t-to do.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Very good. Well done!

#### DAVID

##### [relieved]

##### [deep sighs of relief]

Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Wonderful. And how does that feel, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Warm. Warm and fuzzy.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Warm. Oh, that's good!

#### TREXEL

Mm, thank you.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, so glad.

#### TREXEL

Thank you. Right.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [stammers]

Oh, have you ever heard of a, have you ever heard of a-- an old pastime of bygone years? It's called sang-gang. Have you heard of sang-gang?

#### TREXEL

Sang-gang?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Sang-gang.

#### TREXEL

What's sang-gang?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Sang-gang.

#### DAVID

No.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Sang-gang. Some might have pronounced it as sing-ing.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

Singing!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Sing-ing!

#### TREXEL

Well...

#### IMOGEN

#### DAVID

Eugh.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I actually-- What I wanted for us to achieve was to sing our feelings *at* each other.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay.

#### DAVID

##### [reluctant]

Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

So why don't you start, David 7.

#### TREXEL

Sing your feelings to me, David. Serenade me with your emotional noise.

#### DAVID

Right, so I just... sing what's in my-- my--

#### TREXEL

Just sing what's in your heart.

Yes.

##### [David breathes deeply but is calmer now]

#### TREXEL

It is.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh.

#### TREXEL

It is. You really have to work on your issues, David, 'cause there was a lot there that I think was revealed by Clytemnestra *very* important task.

#### DAVID

Really?! Really? You just didn't pick up on any of the--  Fine. No. Alright.  Go sing.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Thank you for joining me in that.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I felt like it needed some sort of harmony.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

This is not how mediation works.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

So as we can see there, your anger and sadness, David, is uncontrolled and visceral. Whereas mine is locked into a rigid structure, so rigid Clytemnestra joined in. We've all got sadness and anger [__DAVID:__ Oh, great.] but you've got to control it.  Is that right?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Yes.

#### DAVID

So, so what you're saying is there are people there with you in your anger and sadness and no one with me [__TREXEL:__ Well, c--] 'cause David is *all alone*.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Aww, poor David.

#### TREXEL

Well, well that--

#### DAVID

Yes, poor David! That's the whole point! Poor David!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Aww.

#### TREXEL

So let's, let's make David a friend.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Ah, perfect.

#### TREXEL

##### [takes objects out of pockets and puts them on the table]

Okay, well luckily some of the many things that fell out of my pockets are, uh,  toilet rolls and glue and we've got some glitter here as well. So let's, let's, let's make a friend!

#### DAVID

Oh, th--

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Excellent! Oh, wonderful.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

Thank the Board. My problems are gonna be solved by this... little...

#### TREXEL

##### [concentrating on making crafts noises]

Here we go.How many arms? 3?

#### DAVID

...DIY friend.

#### TREXEL

4?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Um... how many arms do we need to hug forever?

#### TREXEL

Hmm... 12.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

12 arms it is.

#### TREXEL

##### [crafting noises, muttering]

Okay, let me--  Okay. Uh, yeah. There we go.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Forever hugs for David 7.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

##### [cuts hand]

Now, I just need to draw a face on, but I haven't got--  Hang on, I'll just cut my hand.  Ahh! Okay, let's just draw a face on there in blood.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

I mean, I have a pen in my pocket. That wasn't necessary.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Oh, you do? Well, I mean, I've-- I've got a bleeding hand now so  we might as well leave it.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [crosstalk]

Well, you might as well use it. Yes, definitely.

#### TREXEL

You know what, in fact, there's quite a lot of blood, let's just colour the whole thing in! Here we go...

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Ah! A nice--

#### TREXEL

A lovely red friend.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

--red friend for David 7.

#### TREXEL

There we go.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Ah!

#### TREXEL

And now I'll need the pen 'cause he's all red now. [__CLYTEMNESTRA:__ Mm.] So if we have the pen now I'll draw the face on top.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Oh, good idea. Here you are. There's one pen.

#### DAVID

Yes, I don't want a faceless... blood friend.

#### TREXEL

There we are. I have got quite a lot of blood on your pen. There we are.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [licks pen]

Ah. That's alright. I'll just lick it clean.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, I'll just--

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Delicious.

#### TREXEL

##### [licks hand]

I'm gonna lick my hand clean.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Mm.

#### TREXEL

Mm.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Everyone needs to *stop* licking things!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Does that mean that we're married now, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

Oh! Oh, interesting because... you've consumed my blood and I've consu-- Ah! Aah, no, because I haven't consumed your blood!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Of--

#### TREXEL

Near miss though!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

--course.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Nearly!

#### TREXEL

Bit of a near miss. Nearly. Nearly. I'm not ready for the commitment, I don't think, about marriage.

#### DAVID

Sorry, what?

#### TREXEL

Hmm? What?

#### DAVID

Bl-- I mean, you're drink-- you drink-- you drink each other's blood??

#### TREXEL

Well, only in the case of marriage, yes. That's-- [__CLYTEMNESTRA:__ Yes, of course.] that's how people get married.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Hmm.

#### DAVID

What is marriage?

#### TREXEL

We exchange blood-- It's the bonding of two people in a way that eventually makes them hate each other.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Does that mean that... *you two* are married?

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

No, I-- no,  you can't marry a clone!

#### DAVID

I mean, I don't bleed so...

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

##### [sobs]

They don't *bleed*! You can't drink what's not there! I should know, I've  upended a lot of empty glasses into my mouth whilst crying and saying, "Where's it all gone?!"

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [sympathetic]

Oh... Oh...

#### TREXEL

So I should know.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Aww.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

So...

#### DAVID

Yeah, we just skipped to the hating each other part.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Sounds efficient to me.

#### TREXEL

Hmm, yes. Very efficient. Very efficient.

#### DAVID

Rrrright. So, hating each other is a good basis for a relationship, is it?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Yes, absolutely.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. Every relationship I've seen, hate hate hate.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Terrible hate.

#### DAVID

Okay. So--

#### TREXEL

And eventually just sort of a tense silence.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Hmm, yes. [__DAVID:__ Well--] An everlasting silence.

#### TREXEL

Yes, until everybody's died.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Mm.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

Oh good. Well, for the record, I deeply and fundamentally hate Trexel Geistman so brilliant.  Session to an end. Complete. It's the perfect relationship. It's the perfect Stellar Firma relationship and that's it, eh?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes!

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

What a breakthrough you've had today, David 7.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

That's the breakthrough?

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I'm not sur-- Yeah, I-- I'm not sure I like-- Clytemnestra, I-- I obviously respect you and your craft and your talent, but I feel like maybe if we establish a relationship of *pure hate*,  we'll be less effective as a team, do you think?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

Well... no. I've been observing you both for some time now. It's-- it's been about 10 or 12 minutes but it--

#### TREXEL

It feels longer, doesn't it?

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

It feels--

#### DAVID [mutters]

It always feels longer with Trexel Geistman.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

--a great deal longer, yes. [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] Um, and what I've concluded from [__TREXEL:__ Oh good.] my assessment of you both [__TREXEL:__ Okay. Yep, yep.] [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] is that you two don't work well together.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

You shouldn't ever work together.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

You shouldn't have been working together for this long.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Interesting.

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

And now I'm going to flush myself away so I don't have to deal with either of you ever again.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

##### [klaxon sounds, mechanism lowers]

#### CLYTEMNESTRA

##### [fades out from sliding down the tube]

Goodbye!

#### TREXEL

Ooh, ooh. There she-- Oh, there she goes!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Extracting mediator.

##### [liquid begins draining]

#### TREXEL

There she goes.

#### DAVID

Oh, I wish I could do that.

##### [liquids finishes draining, mechanism moves back into place]

#### TREXEL

Huh.

#### DAVID

So.

#### TREXEL

So that was a-- that's what I'd call a mixed success. I mean, we've got an assessment of the relationship. The assessment is *no*.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

But, what do we *do* with that I suppose is the question. Um...

#### DAVID

We have no choice, we have to work together.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

But--  What do we *do* with that? I mean, maybe we should stop working together.

#### DAVID

Well that's-- we can't.

#### TREXEL

Well, why not?

#### DAVID

'Cause we're not allowed.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

Oh yes, we're not allowed. Okay, well then,  I suppose we just have to push on through knowing that our relationship is *doomed* by assessment.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

So what was the problem?

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

The problem we have to deal with.

#### DAVID

Right. Uh, well, uh, there was some, uh, Lead Creative Writers at the Legal department that were being beset upon on all sides by prosecutors because their door fell off.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, let's assume the gun walls haven't worked otherwise you go into a "well why should we bother" spiral and we know that that leads nowhere. So, you've got to fight fire with fire. So you should suggest to them that if they're being prosecuted they turn it around, do the old switcheroo. You prosecute me? No, I prosecute you!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Qui prosecutes in accusatores? Securitatem nota.

#### TREXEL

There you go.

#### DAVID

Okay. Oh, right, so you just re-prosecute the pro-- You become prosecutors and re-prosecute the prosecutors.

#### TREXEL

Now, there is always a danger that the prosecutor will turn it around and prosecute you! And then you turn it around and you prosecute them back.

#### DAVID

Ah, so you're like--

#### TREXEL

But then--

#### DAVID

--j'accuse!

#### TREXEL

And then they j'accuse.

#### DAVID

And then they j'accuse!

#### TREXEL

But then you [j'queue??]!

#### DAVID

But j'refuse!

#### TREXEL

Ah but j'who-will-lose? Who can say? You just tie it up for years and years in legal knots!

#### DAVID

Right, so we just make it their problem.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

You bog them down in legal trench warfare.

#### DAVID

Fine. See? Fine. This could have worked! We could have just done this! So why didn't we just do that?

#### TREXEL

Well--

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

##### [writes it down]

We didn't-- No, you-- detectives and, and mediators  and different silly games that you need to do. Right? We could just do this! We did it. This is fine. This will get us through. We've ended the shift. I could write this. Look, I'm gonna write this.  In the tube.

#### IMOGEN

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting.

#### DAVID

And we're done!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

I wanted to do the wall thing.

#### TREXEL

##### [subdued]

Fine. Okay. If you wanna play it like that, David--

#### DAVID

I just wanna play it like we can work and not get killed! I just don't want to die! That's it!

#### TREXEL

Fine, if that's how you feel, then, um...

#### DAVID

Feel like what?!

#### TREXEL

##### [takes a breath]

Just wanna... boil it down to a transactional 5 minutes, you know, at the end of each day. Ooh, what do we do? I suppose this and then push it through the slot and then  I suppose we all just gently age. Is that what you'd like, David?

#### DAVID

I don't even know how long I live!

#### TREXEL

Oh, you know, I do.

#### DAVID

A-and?

#### TREXEL

I'll see you tomorrow, David.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

What-- Really?  Fine, yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I-- I tried. I brought in a mediator. I tried to repair the relationship and you just, you just pick holes.

#### DAVID

Me?

#### TREXEL

You can't just play the game can you David?

#### DAVID

##### [frustrated grunt]

I want you to--  We are playing different games, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Well maybe we need to align rulesets, you know.

#### DAVID

Alright, fine.

#### TREXEL

What happens when you land on "free parking"?

#### DAVID

Um, um, um, um, you do your shift!

#### TREXEL

Interesting. Interesting.

#### DAVID

Wait, how long do I live?

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

Let's not get into it, David. The answer would *only* depress you.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Does that mean a long time or a short time? Both would be depressing in their own ways.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

I--You know what? This has been a long time coming. I don't think I'm gonna come in tomorrow.

#### DAVID

Wait, what?

#### TREXEL

Well, you know, clearly you don't need me.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

You don't, you don't, you don't need my help.

#### DAVID

No no no no no! I-- I do!

#### TREXEL

You can-- you can operate on your own. You don't like me. You said you hated me. [__DAVID:__ Well--] You don't want me here. [__DAVID:__ Is it that--] So you don't like me, you don't want me here--

#### DAVID

That's mutual. That is mutual. No!

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

--you hate me. You can work on it on your own. [__DAVID:__ But-- No--]  So, why should I, why should I bother, David?

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

But they'll-- they'll re--

#### TREXEL

Why should I bother? Right.

#### DAVID

##### [stuttering continues]

##### [door swooshes closed]

##### [sighs loudly]

But they will recycle--  Oh... Aaaahhhhh!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

In many ways it's surprising he turned up every day for this long.

#### DAVID

##### [resigned to death]

Oh, that's it. That's it. That's it. I'm done. Oh.
