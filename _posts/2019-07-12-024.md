##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [talking to self]

##### [sighs, squelchy sounds are heard]

##### [footsteps]

Why is his blood so *sticky*? It just won't... We're about 20 minutes away. He's late as usual... oh, I hope he thinks he caught Mirror Trexel. Calms him down a bit.  Oh, all right...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Hello.

#### DAVID

Hello...

#### TREXEL

How are you?

#### DAVID

Very well, thank you.

#### TREXEL

I'm well.

#### DAVID

Yes. So, did you catch the perpetrator who smashed you with a mirror?

#### TREXEL

No, he slipped away. Slipped away from my grabbing fingers once again.

#### DAVID

Right, yes, then. Nice bandage you've got on your hand.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, I did it myself! Didn't want to go to sick bay. They won't see me anymore.

#### DAVID

Yes. It looks... bad.

#### TREXEL

It's pretty bad, David, pretty bad. Bit of a laceration on the hand there, but I'll find Mirror Trexel one day, and I'll teach him a lesson or two about what real Trexel can do!

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

But that's not important David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I think what's important is that everything is fine!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And this is a regular day.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And we're going to design a planet...

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

We're going to have a lovely time, David...

#### DAVID [uncertainly]

Yes...?

#### TREXEL

##### [threatening]

And everyone's going to enjoy themselves... [__DAVID:__ Yes.] ...and at the end of it, *everybody's going to be* *fine*.

#### DAVID

...okay.

#### TREXEL

So, why don't you grab the brief, David? Why don't you grab the brief then?

#### DAVID

Right, so...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

The brief is from... Sandan--

#### TREXEL [shouting]

Stop right there! Surprise for you!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Come in, Harry!

#### HARRY

Hiya.

#### DAVID

Who?

#### TREXEL

This... is Harry.

#### HARRY

You alright?

#### TREXEL

He's a technician from maintenance!

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

And a good friend of mine from the Cosmic Lounge.

#### HARRY

*Met*. Met. We've met a few times...

#### TREXEL

We've met a lot of times, Harry! We're *friends*! We're *friends*!

#### HARRY [noncommittal]

Mmm.

#### TREXEL

You're my *friend!*

#### HARRY

Yep, okay, we'll round it up to friends.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs tiredly]

We're friends. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And he is going to help me in my little investigation of this little  web of lies that you have, __[DAVID:__ Really?__]__ you big fat lie spider!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### HARRY

I'm just gonna have a look at some stuff.

#### TREXEL

He's gonna have a look at some stuff. Just make sure everything's in order!

#### DAVID

Like the planet? And help us design it? Well? In the next twenty minutes?

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

Sure! Sure, we still need to design a planet, yes, that's what we're doing. That's what we're focused on, not on picking apart your web of lies!

#### DAVID

...*okay.* So?

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### DAVID

So... Sandan Trexiko?

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

They want, they want a planet built to show up their coworker who got a moon last quarter.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

And the one non-negotiable feature is, uh, lakes of fire.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. That's great. __[DAVID:__ So--] Such a regular, normal brief and we're going to __[DAVID:__ Yep.__]__ write things down... on your notes! Grab them, Harry! Grab the notes! Get them! Get them!

##### [overlapping sounds of struggle, ruffling papers]

#### HARRY

I'm sorry about this.

#### TREXEL

Don't apologize to the accused!

#### HARRY

Sometimes it's just best to humour him, just to...

#### DAVID [agreeing]

Oh, it's-- oh, no, no...

#### TREXEL

Harry! You're on *my* side!

#### HARRY

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Now, look at the-- look at the notes there, look at the notes.

#### HARRY

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Anything hidden in there? Perhaps a secret code, perhaps nanobots inside the paper that take the words and twist them into lies?!

#### HARRY

I'll have a look, okay? I'll have a look.

#### DAVID

You think nanobots are rewriting my notes in real time?

#### HARRY

It happens.

#### TREXEL [manic]

I don't know, David! I don't know anymore!

#### DAVID

Does it?

#### HARRY

Yeah. You wouldn't believe the amount of nanobots get in paper.

#### TREXEL

Everywhere!

#### HARRY

Just they've got-- the thing is, they've got like a real telltale kind of droppings. I'm just gonna open up the paper right here...

##### [paper tears]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Employees will be charged for--destruction of stationary!

#### HARRY

I'm looking at the fibers...

#### TREXEL [whispering]

Fibers of lies...

#### HARRY

Nope. No nanobot evidence.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### HARRY

Usually they've got a particular dropping, but I can't...

#### TREXEL

Oh I see.

#### DAVID

So the notes are fine.

#### TREXEL

The notes are fine? Regular paper? Nothing, nothing untoward there, Harry?! Nothing that means that we can flush them out an airlock?

#### DAVID

What? What?!

#### TREXEL

Sorry! Sorry. Gotta calm down.

#### HARRY

Can I go now?

#### TREXEL

No, Harry! You will stay here and you'll help me until we have got to the bottom of this barrel of untruth!

#### DAVID

So like... getting to the bottom of this planet, right?

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

For Sandan?

#### TREXEL

Yes! why not?

#### DAVID

Okay.Brilliant. so we don't know anything about their co-worker, or them, so...

#### TREXEL

Let's look him up, David! Let's look him up on IMOGEN, as you like to look up things on IMOGEN so damn much!

#### DAVID

'Cause it's helpful with the brief?

#### TREXEL [sarcastic]

Oh, it's helpful?

#### DAVID

Information? Yes? Yes?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, everything's so helpful for David 7, whilst Trexel sits in the corner without a single ally! I thought Harry was here on my side, but he's so far been a little bit wavery!

#### HARRY

I'm just helping you out, man, alright?

#### TREXEL

Fine!

#### HARRY

Just... I'll do it, okay?

#### DAVID

It's only a favor, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay! Don't... fraternize! Now, look up Sandan Trexiko.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN online! Client fact file--Sandan Trexiko.

#### DAVID

Sandan Trexiko... looks like they're a galactic bureaucrat.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

They like reading and watching holovids... and, um... there's not much, not much else.

#### TREXEL

Reading and watching holovids?

#### DAVID

Yeah. All of their assessments are very... average.

#### TREXEL

So they're tedious personality vacuum. We should have suspected this of a galactic bureaucrat! The galactic government, which Stellar Firma will have nothing to do with, are a bunch of bores! "Oh, do this! Don't do that! Don't dump your waste there, that's a planet!" They're always giving us a hard time, and it's because they're full of a bunch of boring nincompoops.

#### HARRY

Wait a second. *I* like to watch holovids and, and read.

#### TREXEL

Tell me, Harry, do you also like travel?

#### HARRY

Ehhh... when I can.

#### TREXEL

Do you also like spending time with friends?

#### HARRY

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Do you, do you, perhaps, like keeping up on current events, Harry? Is that, is that an interest of yours, that you might write down and show to someone?

#### HARRY

Yes! On, on my profile.

#### TREXEL

David, this is amazing. What we've got here [__DAVID:__ Right.] in Harry is a perfect simulacrum of a tedious bureaucrat!

#### HARRY [offended]

Excuse me! I'm doing you a favour!

#### TREXEL

Interests so shallow, their personality more thin than a gossamer thread--

#### DAVID

I, I'm sorry about this, Harry.

#### HARRY

No, it's fine.

#### TREXEL

All we need to do is design something that Harry will like and think would show up their coworker, and Bob's your uncle, we've got a planet that this person will love!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Fine. Insults aside... Harry?

#### HARRY

Yes?

#### DAVID

Given that you're like Sandan, and all galactic bureaucrats are the same...

#### TREXEL

Pretty much!

#### DAVID

And your coworker is... a galactic bureaucrat?

#### TREXEL

Stamped out of a cookie cutter of an industry!

#### HARRY

Again, I would like to point out, I am here do you people a favour--

#### DAVID

Look, you're not doing me a favour, and I'm just following the logical progression that Trexel has set up.

#### TREXEL

You're on my side, Harry!

#### HARRY

I can follow the logic.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, if you were gonna have a moon, [__HARRY:__ Yep.]what would you have on it?

#### HARRY

A moon. If I had a moon, Harry's moon... oh man, I'd cut out the craters for starters.

#### TREXEL

You'd cut them out?

#### HARRY

Yeah, cut them out.

#### TREXEL

What, just make it a big, smooth, smooth ball?

#### HARRY

Oh, no, I'd invert the craters. Inverted craters!

#### TREXEL

You mean mountains?

#### HARRY

Yeah, mountains!

#### TREXEL

Okay!

#### DAVID

Okay, what would you have on the mountains? Would you have anything?

#### TREXEL

Just anything interesting, Harry?

#### HARRY

Yeah... yeah! I'd have, uh... I'd have a place to meet friends, and read, and... [__TREXEL:__ Right.] and watch holovids...

#### TREXEL

Right, okay, so you want a living room...You want a living room on a mountain on a moon. Is *that* what you want, Harry?

#### HARRY

Yes![__TREXEL:__ Great, okay...] What-- sorry, what is wrong with that? What is wrong with wanting to watch holovids--

#### TREXEL

It's so tedious! You've got a *moon*, Harry! You could do anything you want with it!

#### DAVID

What would you do then, Trexel?

#### HARRY

What would *you* do with a moon?

#### TREXEL

I would make it the most sumptuous pleasure moon that anyone has ever seen!

#### HARRY

Right.

#### TREXEL

There would be both caverns, canyons, and mountains!

#### HARRY

And what would you do in the caverns, the canyons, the mountains? See your friends and drink?

#### TREXEL

##### [out of breath]

Meet friends and drink-- oh, *no*, you've got me there! You would meet-- maybe everything is just, you know, meeting up with friends... drinking... watching holovids... talking about travel...

#### DAVID

Oh no, Trexel--

#### TREXEL

Oh no!

#### DAVID [overlapping]

No, no, stop-- stop-- quit--

#### TREXEL

We're all just hollow reflections of each other!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning--consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

##### [panicked shouting]

Every person is the same person![__DAVID:__ Okay--] I am nothing, I am not unique!

#### DAVID

IMOGEN, get the spritzer! IMOGEN! Get the spritzer!

#### TREXEL

*I am not--*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Deploying-- no-no spray.

#### TREXEL [spritzing noises]

Oh, I'm being spritzed! Augh! Ough...

#### HARRY

##### [sound of spray retracting]

No, it's okay, man!  It's okay just to have simple pleasures. You just gotta -- make of it.

#### TREXEL

I want complex pleasures to impress people and make them think I'm impressive!

#### HARRY

Well, that's not true, is it? [__DAVID:__ I'd like *any* pleasures.] It's not real. That's just, like... just putting it on. All right, you just gotta take-- you watch a holovid that's real satisfying, you see your friends, that's like... a good day.

#### TREXEL

Harry, you're so wise. So what do you say--

#### DAVID [overlapping]

I wish I had a friend like you.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

Yes, it would be good if you had a friend. What we need to do... the best revenge is living well. So this planet, in order to show up this hollow, tedious moon... just needs to be a place of simple reflection and personal wellness. And by being that personally well and reflective nearby another person's show-off moon, will defeat that moon by its very nature.

#### DAVID

Right!

#### TREXEL

They'll look across and then think, "Ah, I've got a shiny fancy moon this corner, but look at that planet! That person's really got their stuff worked out. *God,* I'm a pile of garbage." And then you've won. And then you've won.

#### DAVID

Okay, so there's no places for reading or meeting friends.

#### TREXEL

No, no, let's cut them out. It's all about spiritual wellness, oneness, calmness, both professional and personal growth. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I think the best way to do that is to-- Harry! Grab his chair!

#### DAVID

What?! No--

##### [sounds of chair scuffle]

#### HARRY

Sorry.

#### TREXEL

This chair has been bothering me for a while. It! Is! Full! Of! Subterfuge! Harry! Analyse the chair!

#### HARRY

Okay, I mean, it's full of some things. That hole in the bottom...

#### TREXEL

##### [sizzling sounds, pained screaming]

Yes. Yes! The hole, that's where he keeps the lies! I'm gonna put my hand in the hole and grab out the lies, Harry! Whoa... Whoa. It burns! *It burns!* Disenfluid *burns!* It was full of disenfluid and chemicals! Ahh!

#### DAVID

What did you expect?!

#### TREXEL

I don't know, I thought it was gonna be full of-- I don't know, secret notes! Or, or, I don't know! I don't know! But, oh... my hand... my hand is...

#### HARRY

Seems to be... semi-dissolved.

#### TREXEL

It's semi-dissolved!

#### HARRY

Oh.

#### DAVID [flatly]

Oh dear. Can I get back on my chair now?

#### TREXEL

Yes, sorry, get back on his chair. Let him back in his chair. The chair is clean. What were we doing?

#### DAVID [losing his patience]

We were designing a planet, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Oh, of course, yes! Let's design the planet. Now.

#### DAVID

So, you want somewhere for spiritual wellness and oneness, nowhere to read, nowhere to meet friends, so a planet of deep and respectful solitude and introspection.

#### TREXEL

Now, you've forgotten something incredibly important, David.

#### DAVID

Is it the lake of fire?

#### TREXEL

It's the lake of fire! How do we have a lake of fire on a planet that's otherwise supposed to be for calmness and spiritual reflection? Fire isn't calm or spiritual, it just ruins things!

#### DAVID

But it is one of the core elements of being.

#### TREXEL [gasps]

Fire, earth, water, air! All four!

#### DAVID

And-- and goo.

#### TREXEL

And goo.[__DAVID:__ Goo.] Are, are we having goo as one of the--

#### DAVID

Well, clone goo. Clones are made from goo. I am, you know, a-- clone goo.

#### TREXEL

Ohh, I didn't want to tell you this this way, David, but, um, no one *cares* about what clones want.

#### DAVID

##### [disappointed]

Oh?  Ohh. Well, actually, I'd pretty much gathered that anyway. That's... so, fine, four, four elements.

#### TREXEL

Oh, he looks so sad Harry, doesn't he?

#### HARRY

Very sad. I mean...

#### TREXEL

Could we include goo, just to--

#### HARRY

So we want a lake of all of these things, do we?

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, so. We've got a lake of fire, a lake of water, a lake of *air*, a lake of *goo*, and a freshly tilled lake of earth. And as you wander past all these things, it allows you to become a spiritually whole person and really *stick it to your coworkers* in the process!

#### DAVID

Yes, well-- and also you mean-- I guess your co-worker would have to know that it's your *planet.*

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So maybe we have these lakes and we have sort of a nexus point at the middle of them, where you sit and meditate on how much better you are than everyone else because you have interests in the spiritual and not physical; material things are pointless like reading and meeting friends...

#### TREXEL

Yes. Exactly.

#### HARRY

Excuse me...

#### DAVID

...and also they need to know that it's Sandan Trexico's planet, so that when they look from their moon they see... Sandan Trexico, so...

#### TREXEL

So the lakes all spell out your name!

#### DAVID

I was thinking like a giant magnifying glass so you look at the,  the Sandan Trexico and you'd see them sitting there.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, I like that! [__DAVID:__ Big head.] And also, the giant magnifying glass will take care of the lake of fire if ever it goes out, cause you just angle that towards the sun-- suddenly, your lake of air? Now it's a lake of fire!

#### DAVID

Good job, Trexel, you've identified a terrible thing about this giant magnifying glass.

#### TREXEL

No, I want to keep that! I want the big magnifying glass!

#### DAVID

But what if it burns up Sandan Trexico?

#### TREXEL

Well then, you know what? C'est la vie.

#### DAVID

I-- I guess that is a very--

#### TREXEL

Because you know what? Whatever will be will be.

#### DAVID

Yep, I--

#### TREXEL

Because you know what? At the end of the day, everything is one.

#### DAVID

Yep, no, I--

#### TREXEL

Because you know what? Really, when it comes down to it? Everything is dust.

#### DAVID

Okay, yeah, that's uh...

#### TREXEL

We are dust.

#### HARRY

Oh, or air. Or goo.

#### TREXEL

Or fire. Or-- we're goo.

#### DAVID

I'm goo.

#### TREXEL

Yes, okay, I'm more of a fire-- what are you? A water type?

#### HARRY

Uhh... wind.

#### TREXEL

You're wind type! Oh, okay, well, I'm, I'm fire type, you're wind type, and you're goo type.

#### DAVID [disappointed]

Goo.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

I'm IMOGEN type!

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. Wonderful!

#### HARRY

Which one beats which one? Is this like that collecting game?

#### TREXEL

Yes, I think... fire type beats goo type...

#### DAVID

Well...

#### TREXEL

But goo type beats wind type. Because you can throw goo into the air, the air gets all gooey.

#### HARRY

I mean, wind can blow goo away with its wind--

#### DAVID

I mean, honestly, reading the room more, I think, like... goo and wind are kind of getting on quite well, and fire's sort of burning out in the corner.

#### TREXEL

I think fire type destroys wind type and goo type, because wind type and goo type need to be put in their place!

#### HARRY

But the wind type could pull the goo type out the fire. We should put the fire out.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

So what you're saying is goo type beats fire type, but fire type beats wind, because *fire* burns *gas*! So I'll burn all your gas up, you big windy gas boy!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN type beats *everyone*!

#### HARRY

But you need me to survive.

#### TREXEL

It's true. I need, I need fuel. I need an ignition source, and I also need oxygen to burn. God, I'm so dependent!

#### DAVID

Yeah, you are quite needy.

#### TREXEL

What is fire without air?!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning--consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

What is fire with friends, reading, and travel?!

#### HARRY

See?

#### TREXEL [whispered]

We are dust.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, I mean, I'm goo. Like, powdered goo, but... right, so, are we-- are we good? Are we-- we've done the planet? We got all the... we've covered everything?

#### TREXEL

The planet seems good, David, and you'd think that means that we were done. But wait -- what's that in the horizon[__DAVID:__ Uh, a breeze, maybe.] Is it a truck following you down an empty highway, ready to drive you off a cliff? Is it perhaps a shark swimming towards your increasingly crumbling piece of wood from a shipwreck? No, it's my suspicious pointing finger of accusation! Harry, check the tubes!

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARRY

Sorry...

#### TREXEL

Check the tubes, Harry! [__HARRY:__ This one?] It's the tubes he used last time to slither and spray, because they are full of lies and they're on* his* side!

#### DAVID

It's just a tube of clone slurry!

#### HARRY

It's a standard slurry tube.

#### TREXEL

It's not-- it *has* to be the tubes! That's all that's left!

#### HARRY [exasperated]

*Look!* Look at it, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

I'm looking in the tubes. [__HARRY:__ Okay.] There's nothing here. Turn it on, Harry! Turn it on!

#### HARRY

It's horrible stuff!

#### TREXEL

Turn it on, Harry, I need to see! I need to see!

#### HARRY

It's not meant for consumption by life! Okay...

##### [clone tube turns on, horrible slurry sounds]

#### TREXEL [pained screeching]

Ahh, my eyes!

#### HARRY

You did that to yourself, man! You did that to yourself--

#### TREXEL

##### [sobs]

My eyes! My eyes!

#### DAVID

He's spent a lot of time covered in clone slurry.

#### TREXEL [distraught]

It's all *fine!*

#### HARRY

It's like he wanted that.

#### TREXEL

It's all regular and fine!

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

I was convinced that there had to be something!

#### HARRY

Come on man.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

*Something!*

#### DAVID

No!

#### HARRY

Trexel, come on... I don't like it when you're in this kind of pit. It's not good.

#### DAVID

You've, you've wasted my time, you've wasted Harry's time... [__HARRY:__ Yeah.] We've wasted Sandan Trexico's time...

#### TREXEL

Wasted everyone's time with my wild accusations. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everybody--

#### HARRY

Let's just do th-- should we sing the song that gets into the happy place?

#### TREXEL

Let's sing the happy drinking song [__DAVID:__ Uhh.] from the happy place. [__DAVID:__ Um, what?] Two, three, four!

Submit the brief! Let's submit it as friends and colleagues and singing buddies.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

Yeah, great and-- oop, there it goes!

#### IMOGEN

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

##### [clunk]

#### DAVID

There. It's gone, there it's-- there it's-- went... it's left the..

#### TREXEL

David, what was that? [__DAVID:__ What?] There was a *noise*. [__DAVID:__ No. No.]  Now I remember why I was so suspicious. [__DAVID:__ No no no no!]There's been a clunking noise every time! [__DAVID:__ No! That's me! Clunk! Clunk!] You try to hide it from me, but the clunking is there! [__DAVID:__ Clunk! Clunk! It's me! Clunk!] Harry?

#### HARRY

Yes.

#### TREXEL

The tubes.

#### HARRY

Oh yeah, okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [David protests]

Look up at the tubes, Harry! Is there something wrong?

#### HARRY

Oh yeah... looks like a bit can come off.

#### TREXEL

Get up there, Harry! Get up on the table and inspect it!

#### HARRY

The-- the-- the brief is stuck in this, in this tube.

#### TREXEL

Gimme the brief, Harry! Gimme the brief!

#### HARRY

There you go.

#### DAVID [unconvincingly]

Oh, that's weird! Oh, what is that? I've never seen that...

#### TREXEL [fuming]

This is *our* brief, David. __[DAVID:__ Mmmmmhm, no it's..__]__ This is my work, and it's stuck in the tube! Why is it stuck in the tube, David?

#### DAVID

No idea!

#### TREXEL

Is there a problem with the tube?

#### DAVID

Faulty tube?

#### TREXEL [screaming]

I do think __[DAVID:__ Faulty--__]__ someone has tampered with the room and is changing *my work*!

#### DAVID

No!

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL [screaming]

*Burn it all down!*

#### DAVID

What?! No! Don't burn it all down--

#### TREXEL

*Burn it all!*

#### DAVID

Don't burn anything!

#### HARRY

I'll get the flamethrower.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

What? No, no, no, no, no flamethrowers! Anything but the flamethrowers, okay!

#### TREXEL

Anything but the flamethrowers?

#### DAVID

Well, no, not anything!

#### TREXEL

*Anything?*

#### DAVID

Ideally nothing!

#### TREXEL

Harry, reset the room.

#### HARRY

What?

#### TREXEL

Reset it all, Harry!

#### HARRY

That is not sensible to do while we're in it. Come on--

#### TREXEL

Reset it, Harry, I want to see it all change!

#### HARRY

All right, okay. Are you sure?

#### TREXEL

Absolutely.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Scanning for--maintenance permissions.

#### HARRY

Okay, just turning on now.

#### IMOGEN

Permissions granted. Total system reset initiated.

##### [loud whirring sounds, screaming]

#### DAVID

Oh, the chair! Oh, it's sucking! Whooo!!

##### [whirring fades out and screaming stops]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Total system reset completed. Please register new IMOGEN terminal user.

#### TREXEL

Pure and cleansed! [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] The room has been cleansed of your tainted lies, David! [__DAVID:__ Okay.]But the brief remains impure! It's an impure brief!

#### DAVID

No, can we just submit it anyway?

#### TREXEL

##### [screaming]

No one shall have it! It's mine and no one else shall have my brief!

#### DAVID

##### [door swooshes closed]

No! No! What's gonna happen if we don't submit the brief --  Ohh, no... I can't believe he's got the brief...

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Deadline missed! Line manager notified.

##### [alarms blare]

#### HARRY [slightly panicked]

Well, uh, I'll be off, then. I've got a spreadsheet to look at... Nice meeting you.

#### DAVID

Yeah, okay, Harry.

#### HARRY

Uhh... I'll see you later.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

##### [resigned]

Yeah, see you never. Ohh... I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. This is it. Oh... damn.
