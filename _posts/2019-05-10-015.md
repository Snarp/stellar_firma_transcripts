##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [approaching footsteps]

#### DAVID [frustrated noise]

Still not here... three! *Three* reviews in a row! Three! Just... what, what is he doing?!

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL [audibly sick]

*David...*

#### DAVID

Oh! Oh!

#### TREXEL

*David, help me.*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Bulbous consultant detected!

#### DAVID

Uh-- oh, *no,* you are bulbous!

#### TREXEL

*David, please*.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

#### DAVID

Why are you so bulbous?!

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### TREXEL

*David, I have been drinking moisturiser for the entirety of the time since I was last here. I haven't let any moisture out of my body in about 16 hours, David, and it hurts.*

#### DAVID [nauseous]

Oh...

##### [sobbing]

__*TREXEL:* __*It hurts, David.*

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Umm...

#### TREXEL

*David, you have to squeeze me. Ohh, David, you have to squeeze it out of me.*

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk] [beep]

Please drain your consultant!

#### DAVID

Um, okay--

#### TREXEL

*David, grab hold of me.* [__DAVID:__ Right, yes.] *Grab hold of me, David, and--*

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk] [beep]

Line manager arriving!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk] [cheerfully]

Oh, hello! I-- *oh.* What's... going on here??

#### TREXEL

*Hartro, I can explain. I can explain. I was supposed to be on time. I learned. I learned my lesson, I-- I promise--*

#### HARTRO

Why do you look so... spherical?

#### TREXEL

*I've drank lots of moisturiser and I think it's caught up with me...*

#### HARTO [crosstalk]

Oh, of course you have... ugh.

#### TREXEL

*David... David, squeeze me...*

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Right. Okay. Three...

#### HARTRO

Wait, wait, wait. Let me get behind the chair.

#### DAVID

Three... two... one...

##### [David and Trexel strain as they squeeze out the moisturiser. It's gross.]

#### HARTRO

Ohh, it's disgusting!

##### [loud splat as moisturiser is expunged]

#### TREXEL [satisfied]

Oh... that's nice...

#### DAVID [traumatized noises]

#### HARTRO

Oh, Trexel, what a horrible way to start things. That is *disgusting.*

##### [David whoops as he slips and falls on moisturiser, continues to make traumatised noises]

#### TREXEL

Oh, he's fallen. Ah... oh, that's wonderful. Oh, I'm so flappy now! Look at all my excess skin.

#### HARTRO

What?! What on earth has made you drink moisturiser, Trexel?!

#### TREXEL

I... picked up a bit of a habit, I have to admit. I was getting some for David-- It's not important.

#### HARTRO

Oh my God, you'd be addicted to addiction if you could!

#### TREXEL

I am! I am!

#### DAVID [shakily]

I'm so gooey again... [__TREXEL:__ So gooey.] Like I've just been born.

#### TREXEL

Ah, it must be nice for you, then! Remember being born?

#### DAVID

It was very, yes, recent.

#### TREXEL

Lot's of fun. Lot's of fun.

#### HARTRO

Well, guess what? I'm not here to watch moisturiser coming out of a body. I'm-- We're here to do a review.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I'm sorry.

#### HARTRO

##### [sighs]

##### [slippery sounds]

I need to sit. David-- oh, you've fallen off your chair. I'm sitting here. Right. Two things I'm upset about that we need to discuss before I can even begin to review your... planet. *Urghh.* Right, one. Last weekend. Ah! You were supposed to be somewhere. Yes, in fact-- oh, I remember! You *killed* several parents and created orphans. [__TREXEL:__ Orphans...] Oh, by dumping lava all over their families. [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes.] Do you remember now?

#### TREXEL

That is coming back to me, yes.

#### HARTRO

And I thought, oh, wouldn't it be nice to give you a chance to go and entertain the orphans in a way to, you know, make good on the horribleness that you've done.

#### TREXEL

Yes, in the marmalade cresh, if I remember correctly. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] I... *did* forget. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] I did-- I *did* forget. I went into work--

#### HARTRO

Yes. You sure you didn't try to just get away?

#### TREXEL

Well-- you know what? Hands up in the air? That's possible. But I *did* go into a vent, and then I immediately forgot why I'd gone in there, and then by the time I'd realized I didn't know why I was supposed to be in there, I tried to get back and I was lost, and it felt like things were moving? And then it got really hot, and then really cold--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

You're like a very, very sad cat, aren't you?

#### TREXEL

A-- a sad cat?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, you know, they always go into ducts and hide.

#### TREXEL

Yes, Hartro, I am in many ways like a sad cat.

#### HARTRO

##### [gleeful]

Oh, yeah, and you got hot and you got cold. That might have had something to do with *me*. [__TREXEL:__ What d'you mean?] Hahaha. I thought, 'Oh, look at my tracker! Oh, look, Trexel's not where he's supposed to be!' And I noticed that you were in a duct. So I thought, I could just turn up the heat, just a *little* bit... [__TREXEL:__ Did... did you heat my duct?!] Just-- just turn-- turn the air-conditioning on... [__TREXEL:__ Chilled my duct?] I did.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

Was it unpleasant?

#### TREXEL

It was very unpleasant.

#### HARTRO ["Oh, you poor baby"]

Ooh... *sorry*.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

I don't have much skin on my hands anymore. Although now, I've got so much *excess* skin from all the moisturising, I could probably fold some over. So, y'know. Comme ci, comme ça.

#### HARTRO

Well... that was very bad. But I feel you've paid your just desserts.

#### TREXEL

Paid in skin!

#### HARTRO

Yes. Ooh... sore. Right. And, oh-- problem number the two. You're late again.

#### TREXEL

Yes. [__HARTRO:__ A-*gain*.] But-- but it was *because* I was full of moisturiser, and stuck in a number of narrow hallways--

#### HARTRO

But *is* that my problem? [__TREXEL:__ Uhh--] I mean, *is* that something I need to know? Like, 'Oh, is Trexel *maybe* going to drink moisturiser today, and show up late? Ah!' No, that's not normal problems! The other design teams don't *do* this to me, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

They don't?

#### HARTRO

No! They show up! I review planets, it's a pleasant time! We eat cookies!

#### TREXEL [genuine curiosity]

There's cookies??

#### HARTRO

*Yes!* No cookies for you!

#### TREXEL

I want cookies--

#### HARTRO

In fact, the only thing that's going in your mouth is *David's foot*.

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

What?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

Uhh.

#### HARTRO

David, strip your foot.

#### DAVID [uncomfortable]

Oh...

#### TREXEL

He's wearing a onesie!

#### HARTRO

*I* don't care!

##### [sounds of effort as David attempts to take the (nonexistent) socks off his onesie, ripping]

#### TREXEL

Oh, he's torn it.

#### HARTRO

Just rip it. I don't care how he gets it off! Are you wearing socks, David?

#### DAVID

*No!* No! Of course not.

#### TREXEL [hushed]

Hartro, he doesn't like socks. Don't go into the--

#### HARTRO

So what, even if I say 'socks'?

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### HARTRO

Wh-- sock??

#### DAVID [more agitatedly]

Ah!!!

#### HARTRO

##### [David yelps]

##### [to Trexel]

##### [threatening]

What's wrong with socks?! You are *so strange*, you two! Get your foot in his mouth. And *you* need to tell me that you will never be late again. *And make me believe it.*

#### DAVID

Right, ahh... s-- sorry, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I understand.

#### HARTRO

##### [whispers]

Don't be *sorry*. Or I'll say 'socks.'

##### [muffled speech]

#### TREXEL [muffled]

*Oh, god-- what is the taste of your foot, David?!*

#### HARTRO

##### [David shoves foot in more and begins intermittently making grossed out sounds]

David, I don't believe that you're actually trying to put it in. [__DAVID:__ Uh-- okay, sorry.] It's just kind of hanging around the lip area. It needs to be difficult for him to talk.

#### TREXEL [approximate sound]

*Oughhghhh*.

#### HARTRO

Now, Trexel.

#### TREXEL [questioning noise]

#### DAVID

His tongue's so smooth...

#### HARTRO

What did you do.

#### TREXEL [muffled]

*I was late.*

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel echoes]

You've been late a hundred times. An even hundred. That's why today is so special.

#### TREXEL [muffled]

*I'm sorry... for being... late*.

#### HARTRO

He's sorry for being...

#### TREXEL [more desperate]

*For being late!!!*

#### DAVID

Eugh, he's trying to say late, I can feel that.

#### HARTRO

Can you feel the L? That'd be, like, a tongue-y... letter.

#### TREXEL [starts talking again]

#### HARTRO

And?

#### TREXEL [muffled]

*And I'll never do it again.*

#### DAVID

It's like a fat slug stroking the bottom of my foot...

#### HARTRO

Okay, so...

#### TREXEL[muffled]

*I'll never be late again.*

#### HARTRO

Do you believe him?

#### TREXEL [muffled]

*Please, David, please-- nehh...*

#### DAVID

He's saying 'please' to me, and he's not done that before, so I think he does mean it.

#### HARTRO

All right, you can take it out.

__[slurping sound of David's foot being removed]__

#### TREXEL

Auughhhh.

#### HARTRO

Trexel, I don't enjoy that. [__DAVID:__ Ooh, it's so smooth.] I'm very sorry that I had to do that, but you very much did it to yourself.

#### TREXEL

David... David, your foot tastes like week-old hot beef on a radiator.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel coughs weakly]

Um... thank you?

#### HARTRO

Right, onto the planets.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file!

#### HARTRO

##### [struggles to pronounce]

Serafina Mouchet. Ah, that's labyrinths, and robot gondol-- golden-- gondil...

#### TREXEL

Oh, oh-- Hartro.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Right-- yes.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Two, three, four...

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

♪ Golden robot gondoliers! ♫

#### TREXEL

One for you. And one for me!

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

♪ Golden robot gondoliers! ♫ [__HARTRO:__ Wha--]

#### TREXEL

Where are they?Who are we?

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

♪ Golden robot gondoliers! ♫ [__HARTRO:__ Okay, what are you doing?]

#### HARTRO

What are-- you're singing and dancing. You made up a song? [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] For this planet? [__DAVID:__ Yes, for the golden robot...] This planet does *not* deserve a song!

##### [...]

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel quietly begins reciting the song]

You did something very naughty! *You* put a little bit of I.M.O.G.E.N. into these robot-- don't sing the song. Don't you dare. [__TREXEL:__ Sorry.] So you decided to give them a bit of I.M.O.G.E.N.. [__TREXEL:__ Just a little bit of I.M.O.G.E.N.!] You *cannot* give them a little bit of I.M.O.G.E.N.! [__TREXEL:__ Just a little-- some of I.M.O.G.E.N.!] *No!* I.M.O.G.E.N. is like Stellar Firma Ltd.'s head. And you thought you could cut off our nose, and give it to a different planet?

#### TREXEL

As you say it back to me, that *does* sound bad. Even a dumbed-down version of I.M.O.G.E.N. is, yes, one of the most powerful entities on-- on the face of the universe.

#### HARTRO

Even-- yes! Even a speck of Imogen is *not* dumbed-down. 'Dumb' doesn't go in the same sentence as 'I.M.O.G.E.N.'.

#### TREXEL

Right, right, right.

#### HARTRO

In fact, I bet if she's-- well, she *is* listening, isn't she? [__TREXEL:__ She's *always* listening!] She's *not* going to be happy about that.

#### TREXEL

I.M.O.G.E.N.? How do you feel about me giving a tiny part of you to a client?

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Watch it, buster!

#### TREXEL

Not happy.

#### HARTRO

No. No, so.

#### TREXEL

Obviously this would have been caught down the line.

#### HARTRO

*You* should have caught this! In fact, David 7, *you* should have caught this!

#### DAVID

Uh huh.

#### TREXEL

Yes, David.

#### HARTRO [warning]

*Stop it,* Trexel. Trexel, *I* do the telling off. [__TREXEL:__ I'm sorry.] You sit quietly. [__TREXEL:__ I'm sorry.] David 7?

#### DAVID

Yes. I... was sleepy at... the time? ...Sorry.

##### [...]

#### HARTRO [sighs]

Right. Don't *ever* let Trexel give out any bit of Imogen. Just... *don't* let it happen. I shouldn't need to say this. Anyway, one more thing about that last planet, the Build Team have sent something back. Apparently they didn't need it, it was broken, anyway here you go, it's some sort of... I don't know.

#### TREXEL

It's a smashed graph friend. [__DAVID:__ Oh!] David, this is Henry!

#### DAVID [feigning concern]

Oh-- oh, no. Oh, Henry.

#### TREXEL

Poor Henry, smashed in his prime. [__DAVID:__ Ohh... ] I commiserate with you, David. I know...

#### DAVID [not sad at all]

So sad.

#### TREXEL

...that a person and their graph friend, it's a bond that only rivals the love of a parent. I mean, obviously, *I* have Percy at home, and if anything happened to Percy like this, well, I don't know what I'd do. I'd probably just...

#### HARTRO

It's a *toy*.

#### TREXEL

It's a friend! It's a graph friend! You wouldn't understand, Hartro, you had other friends as a child.

#### HARTRO [dryly]

I have *real* friends.

#### TREXEL

Me and David here... we're different. We're friendless in this world.

#### HARTRO

I'm *definitely* different.

#### TREXEL

I haven't seen Percy in a long time...

#### DAVID [quickly]

Oh, I'm sure he'll turn up. Um, so...

#### HARTRO

Next planet.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file!

#### HARTRO

Bathin, the Great Duke of Galactonium. [__TREXEL:__ Hmm...] And he is *great*, isn't he? Oh... I love working with him!

#### TREXEL [grumbling]

Yes, yes, yes, what about Bathin, what did he think of his planet?

#### HARTRO

Oh yes, oh, um, well, he's filled out a feedback form!

#### DAVID

Oh, that's very helpful!

#### HARTRO

So conscientious of him, isn't it? I've got it here, and--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

#### HARTRO

Oh. Oh, no, it's just... it was just a photo of him... with his autograph. That's strange... lovely, isn't it?

#### DAVID

What handsome nipples he has!

#### HARTRO

##### [appreciative]

He does! And he's *strong*, isn't he? But it looks like he's sensitive as well? [__DAVID:__ Yes, big soft arms. Mmm.] Like I feel like you could talk to him if you had a problem.

#### DAVID

Maybe just lay your head on his... chest.

#### TREXEL

Is there any actual *feedback* or is this just...

#### HARTRO

Oh, I took some notes, so I'll just see the... oh, no. No, it's just more photos of Bathin-- oh, David 7, look at this.

#### DAVID

Is he-- is he making six cocktails at once?

#### HARTRO

How-- how could you even *do* that? [__DAVID:__ I know!] And he makes it look-- he looks like he'd be-- it's *fun*. You know? I want to go over there and, and have one of them.

#### DAVID

He's not even trying. [__HARTRO:__ No.] He's talking to you and listening actively, at the same time as making six cocktails.

#### HARTRO

Trexel! Look!

#### TREXEL [halfheartedly]

Isn't... 's nice.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

#### HARTRO

And-- and look at this one! Oh, he's studying! His glasses... what's he reading there? Oh... oh, "How to Make Yourself A More Understanding Person".

#### TREXEL [snappish]

Now, *that* doesn't seem like a real book!

#### HARTRO

But it is! Look, it's right there.

#### DAVID

##### [Hartro dreamily sighs]

Quite big. Very small text, actually, I think is that... so it's a dense read. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] But he seems to be really into it, actually...

##### [...]

#### HARTRO

Trexel, why do you look so angry?

#### TREXEL

##### [whispered fervently]

Well, I just-- I just feel like we're spending a lot of time talking about how good Bathin is, while everybody in this room knows *full well* that I do not get on with Bathin.

#### HARTRO

Oh, you know Bathin?

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### HARTRO

You know Bathin?!

#### TREXEL

I do-- You *know* I know Bathin!

#### HARTRO

Oh-- tell me about Bathin!

#### TREXEL

He's-- an-- an old school-- I'm gonna say *friend* of mine, but we didn't get on.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

And Bathin's a-- I don't want to be coarse, but in my opinion, Bathin's an idiot.

#### HARTRO [offended gasp]

Take it back.

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry, that's how I feel, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

Do you know what? He's a respectable man. He does good things. He has several charities. Do you have a charity? Do you have *one* charity? He has seven charities that I can think off the top of my head!

#### TREXEL

What-- what for? What are these charities?

#### HARTRO

Oh-- one charity for... people who don't know where their spaceship is. Do you ever have it when you lose your spaceship. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Well, he's got something for that! [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] People who don't like to shop. [__TREXEL:__ I know people hate that.] Just the other day, I didn't feel like shopping, I just called up his charity and somebody came and shopped for me. He's a lovely man. He makes the world better, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Fine, I take it back... Bathin is a wonderful person and a valued client.

#### HARTRO

Hmm. Fair. Was that so hard?

#### TREXEL

##### [David and Hartro make shocked and disgusted noises]

Well, if you think he's got handsome nipples, why don't ya get a load of *these* boys?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning! Nipples detected. Security alerted!

#### HARTRO

No, stop!

#### TREXEL

See? We've all got handsome nipples!

#### DAVID

Oh, so *dry...*

#### TREXEL

Yes. Well, since you squeezed all the moisture out of me, David, it's dry and flappy now.

#### HARTRO [disgusted]

Put it down. Put it down.

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro sighs in relief]

Okay. I'll hush these puppies away. So, see? Both Bathin and I have very handsome nipples, so it's not *all* his game!

#### DAVID [supremely upset]

Like tiny blue calderas.

#### HARTRO

Oh. Ergh, okay. Let's just shake that off. Uh... back to business!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file!

#### HARTRO

Psilax Bromius, the party planet! Yes, yes, yes, yes. The ultimate rave in space.

#### TREXEL

Yes! The space rave.

#### HARTRO

Well, I don't know *how,* but you've actually managed to make a party that teenagers *like*.

#### TREXEL

A success! A success, David!

#### DAVID

Oh, we did well!

#### HARTRO

No, no--

#### TREXEL

They love it! Grab the-- champagne! Champagne!

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, no! It's bad! It's terrible! Because all of the teenagers in the galaxy are going to this planet!

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

##### [doots]

That's what we *wanted!* That's what we wanted, a super-- a super cool party with music I'm scared of... Dance now.

#### HARTRO

Trexel. *All* of the teenagers are going. We're losing our youth. In fact, some of these teenagers have parents who are *senior executives*!

#### TREXEL

Oh, *no*.

#### HARTRO

It is not good.

#### TREXEL

Not good at all, no! No, we have to stop this! If-- if the senior executives get wind that all of their teens have been enticed onto my rave planet, then-- then-- then I'll never-- I'll never get another decent assignment again! We have to stop this, Hartro, we have to stop this!

#### HARTRO

You don't think I know this?

#### DAVID

We could just end the party! [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] We could just end the party, we built it in!

#### TREXEL

We built in a party ender!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

If it was that simple, we would do that!

#### TREXEL

But you just-- you just press the party end button, and then __[DAVID:__ Moon crashes in] a moon just crashes in and it turns into a burning star!

#### HARTRO

...okay, do you see the problem there?

#### TREXEL [muttering to himself]

##### [realization]

Okay, hang on there.Well, you crash the moon into the burning star, and then everybody dies... everybody dies.

#### DAVID

Ahhh.

#### HARTRO

Everybody, including very important teenagers to senior executives.

#### TREXEL

V.I.P. teens.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

So we cannot do that.

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro gasps]

Righty-o. Well, in my experience, parties always end about 15 minutes after I arrive, so. So surely it can't be long for this world!

#### HARTRO

That is brilliant.

#### TREXEL

What's brilliant? Have I had a good idea?

#### HARTRO

Oh my gosh, Trexel, I don't know how you've *accidentally* had so many brilliant ideas, but, you go! *You* go! Yes, oh, lovely, yes, oh, I love that.

#### TREXEL

##### [imitates 'cool teen' voice]

What do you mean? If I go, surely people will think it's even hipper. 'Trexel's here! Look at this. Look at him. Look at that.'

#### HARTRO

Trexel, I'm counting on the fact that that *won't* happen.

#### TREXEL

All right. I'll-- I'll make you a bet.

#### HARTRO

All right!

#### TREXEL

I'll go there and I'll turn up. And yes, parties do tend to end pretty quickly after I finish! But only because they're all, like, 'Whoa, this party's *too* hot!'

#### HARTRO

I have an idea. [__TREXEL:__ What?] Yes. Yes. You'll go this weekend. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Lovely! And you take off your shirt! Fantastic. David 7, I'm brilliant, don't you think?

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, absolutely.

#### HARTRO

'Cause it was horrible, wasn't it?

#### DAVID

The nipples.

#### HARTRO

I wanted to be away.

#### DAVID [haunted]

The nipples.

#### TREXEL [offended]

All right, all right, we can all agree that my nipples maybe aren't the best, but they've got-- they've got something to offer to the world.

#### DAVID

We'll just offer them to the party.

#### TREXEL

Well, okay, yes. We'll take them to the masses! I'll lift up my shirt to the party and shout, "Hey teens: here's the nips!" and then we'll see what happens. Okay?

#### HARTRO

Ah, I think that's good as done!

#### TREXEL

Good. Well, I didn't have any plans this weekend so I look forward to it!

#### HARTRO

Yeah. And we know you like to party.

#### TREXEL

I love to party!

#### IMOGEN

Consultant design recommendation file!

#### HARTRO

##### [scoffs]

##### [Trexel "mhm"s]

Lorek Brynison's planet, the armoured polar bears, yes. Oh come-- that should have been so easy? Right? You just build a sphere of ice, and you realize how sensitive this is! And you've already killed two of their planets!

#### TREXEL

Hartro, I went into this planet so carefully. I have *personally* caused two world deaths for these people. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] So I made it very, very clear to David, and to myself when we were designing it, that we can on no account let them know that we are even *thinking* about heating up any sort of ice on their planet. And I think I nailed it.

#### HARTRO

You* hid* heaters in accountants.

#### TREXEL

Who looks at accountants? Who looks at accountants?

#### HARTRO

Apparently polar bears! I mean there's flesh, there's blood. I mean, that just says "tasty morsel"!

#### TREXEL

But-- but there were seals! And we made them accountants to make them less enticing!

#### HARTRO

It's still flesh, come on! Doesn't matter if your food's boring, you still eat it.

#### TREXEL

That is true. You eat mostly mush, don't you, David?

#### DAVID

Uh, yes. Yes. Slurry.

#### TREXEL

Yes. I just *drink*.

#### HARTRO

Moisturiser...

#### TREXEL

Moisturiser, mostly. Very fattening.

#### HARTRO

Hmm.

##### [...]

#### TREXEL

So they've eaten the accountants.

#### HARTRO

They're very upset. Yes, they really-- really only had to eat one accountant, because once you eat one accountant and you realize, actually it's a heating mechanism, there's, um, "Oh! Oh, looks like they're trying to kill us again!" [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] "That old Trexel Geistman, third planet's the charm!"

#### TREXEL

Did they-- do they know it was *me* specifically?

#### HARTRO

Oh yes, they know it was you.

#### TREXEL

Ah.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. *Not* good. Oh, and guess who's reached out to them?

#### TREXEL

Uh-- is it you? Is it you with an apology on my part?

#### HARTRO

Well, of course I've reached out to them, I've smoothed it over like I always do, as best I can. But no, they don't want to see me, because now they're in alliance with the megatrons! Ha-- the *other* planets that hate us! This is not good.

#### TREXEL

Yes. To be fair, I'm not at fault for the megatrons, that was humanity.

#### HARTRO

Well, yes, but we don't want them working together, and they are. And you are at fault for that. So it's twice as bad.

#### TREXEL

Okie-dokie.

#### HARTRO

I don't understand, David 7.

#### DAVID

Uh, yes?

#### HARTRO

That was an *obvious* warlike situation, which Trexel created. Why did--

#### TREXEL

David, are you trying to *sabotage* me?

#### DAVID [flatly]

No.

#### TREXEL

*Et tu*, David!? [__DAVID:__ No.] A viper in my bosom! I clutched you to my breast--

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Oh. No...

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Oh, hold your horses.

#### TREXEL

Like a kindly snake, and it turned out you would try and *bite me!*

#### DAVID

Just... very sleepy... sorry!

#### HARTRO

*And*-- and, you requested a particle accelerator.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### HARTRO

I think once your data's been loaded, David 7, you get, what do you have, oh... subservience... Yet right after the subservience, I think that's when they add the "don't start wars" [__TREXEL:__ Don't cause wars, yep.] and... "don't request particle accelerators". [__TREXEL:__ Yeah, don't-- don't--] It's very clear.

#### TREXEL

Do not mess with the fabric of reality.

#### HARTRO

And yet that-- I have an alert here that's been issued from I.M.O.G.E.N., that you did do that.

#### DAVID

Well... Trexel's very forceful... and I-- I-- I also need to support... the designer in their-- their desires, so.

#### HARTRO

##### [quickly]

You do! You need to work together, you're a team-- that's it! There's not enough teamwork going on! Ooh, that gives me an idea. Ah, yes, I know exactly what I'll do. [__TREXEL:__ Right, what are you going to do?] Uh, brilliant! Great! Oh, you'll see. Ah... bad job, and... planets bad, and... see you later. Bye!

##### [slippery sound as she stands, door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Bye, Hartro.

#### DAVID

Bye. Bye. Okay... I hope that doesn't involve feet.

#### TREXEL [solemnly]

David, it's always certainly going to involve feet in some way. I don't know why and I don't know how, but when Hartro Piltz has an idea and it's to do with me, it's gonna end up with a foot in my mouth.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

But she has a point, David!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [suspiciously]

Previously, most clones have, you know, given me a bit of a heads up about this sort of stuff. Sure, I've ignored them. Sure, they've been recycled, but they yammer on, saying, "No, Trexel, no, this is against my directives!" And that hasn't happened a *single* time with you.

#### DAVID

Up... graded models...

#### TREXEL

I know what's going on, David! [__DAVID:__ Uh...] I know exactly what's happening here! [__DAVID:__ Wh--] You try and trick me and hide it from me, David, but I've got to the core of the idea. [__DAVID:__ Wha--?]I know what this has all been about! [__DAVID:__ What--] Weeks on weeks you've been here and now I understand it! *I need another pint of moisturiser!* That's it, isn't it?! I've got distracted, what are we doing? I'm thirsty. Bye bye!

##### [slippery sound as he stands, door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Ahh... um. How do I fix this?
