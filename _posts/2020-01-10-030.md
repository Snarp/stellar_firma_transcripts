Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [peaceful self-care music plays]

##### [footsteps, door opens]

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

##### [startled]

##### [screams intermittently]

Ah! Oh! What?!

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ David, get up! Sit down! Turn around! Not there, get on the floor! Leave-- leave me alone! Leave me alone! Stop interrogating me!

#### DAVID

##### [frazzled sounds]

Trexel! Trexel! Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Right, sorry!

#### DAVID

Wha-- why?

#### TREXEL

I panicked.

#### DAVID

What-- *I* panicked!

#### TREXEL

We're panicking.

#### DAVID

Yes, why are we panicking?!

#### TREXEL

Maybe it's because of the pod, David. Maybe we need to take the pod away.

#### DAVID

No!!

#### TREXEL

It's clearly causing... problems.

#### DAVID

No! No, no, the pod is the one shining light in my otherwise miserable and gray existence, don't take the pod away!

#### TREXEL

I don't know why you're complaining, David!

#### DAVID

Because you came in and just started shouting instructions at me!

#### TREXEL

You can't prove anything!

#### DAVID

This is *recorded* for the Bo-- wait. Wait, who is this recorded for?

#### TREXEL

That's a very good question, David!

##### [beat]

#### DAVID

Which I'd like an answer for!

#### TREXEL

I'm sure you would, and so would I!

#### DAVID

Right, okay, so what you're saying is you don't *know*... who this goes to or why this is recorded?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

The answers to some questions are--immediate recycling.

#### TREXEL

David, you're very question-y today, and I don't like the questions.

#### DAVID

Um, okay.

#### TREXEL

The important thing is, let's get down to sales business! Where's the brief?

#### DAVID

##### [pause]

Okay, right, I'll go get the--  Wait, where's the brief?

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Where's the brief, David?

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ No, but where's-- where's the brief?

#### TREXEL

Where's the brief. David?

#### DAVID

No, but there is no brief.

#### TREXEL

David, there's got to be a brief!

#### DAVID

No, look! __[____crosstalk____]__ Look in the-- look in-- l-- look in the--

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ How can you sales without a brief? Brief is sales, sales is brief! Equals *sales brief!*

#### DAVID

Look in the brief hole!

#### TREXEL

##### [muttering]

Hang on.

#### DAVID

See?

#### TREXEL

There's just an empty, hollow lack of brief!

#### DAVID

It's an empty brief hole! [__TREXEL:__ Well, hang on.] There's no brief!

#### TREXEL

What day is it, David?

#### DAVID

What day? It's... well, it would be review day, but-- we don't do reviews anymore!

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ We don't have reviews anymore.

#### DAVID

So where's the brief? [__TREXEL:__ I don't know!] Am I gonna go on trial again?!

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

David!

#### DAVID

Am I gonna-- what?

##### [sounds of Hartro screaming as she falls through the tube]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Line manager arriving.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ David! David! Oh, no!

#### DAVID

Wait, wait, wai--

##### [Hartro lands with a splash, panicked screaming from David and Trexel]

#### DAVID

Hartro! Hartro!

#### TREXEL

HARTRO! HARTRO!

#### HARTRO

Ah...

#### DAVID

*Why is Hartro here?!*

#### TREXEL

WHY IS HARTRO HERE?!

#### HARTRO

##### [incredibly strained]

Hello,* boys!*

#### TREXEL

I THOUGHT WE LEFT YOU, YOU SCOURGE OF BOARD!

#### HARTRO

You can't leave me, Trexel, and apparently I can never leave you *either.*

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ But it's not review day...

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ What did you do? What did you *do?!*

#### HARTRO

I've just come from the stakeholders' meeting! And guess what?

#### TREXEL

##### [all panic forgotten]

Ooh! Ooh! A game! Um... the stakeholders have fired you. Out of a cannon into space!

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel groans]

##### [David lets out a troubled "Oh..."]

Trexel, I am continuing to be your line manager,  so you can relax now! And David 7,  look at the ease on his face... the joy in the eyes...

#### DAVID

##### [weakly]

Yaaaay.

#### HARTRO

I am here.

#### DAVID

Hartro's here...

#### HARTRO

Truth has been restored and the stakeholders, they just needed a little probing and reminding that we come as a *team*.

#### TREXEL

A *team?*

#### HARTRO

Oh, we come as a team...

#### TREXEL

We're a team like a... shark eating a *horse* is a team!

#### HARTRO

##### [gleeful]

Yes, and I'm the shark!

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro laughs evilly]

Oh, I'm a horse! Ah, look at my hooves! My wanton hooves!

#### DAVID

I am David.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

I'm IMOGEN!

#### TREXEL

Well, *Hartro*, I've got a little problem that I think you're going to struggle to solve!

#### HARTRO

Shoot.

#### TREXEL

You review us for our planet designs!

#### DAVID

Yes-- no planets, no reviews!

#### TREXEL

##### [David makes approving sounds]

No planet design! Sure-- [__HARTRO:__ Yeah.] we knock a couple of ideas about, but mostly it's about meetings! Of minds, of people, *ideas...*

#### DAVID

And that'll be client feedback! [__TREXEL:__ You can't review that!] Not Hart-reviews.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ You can't review that!

#### HARTRO

If I didn't know better, I would think that you didn't want me here--

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ NO! Not what we're talking about!

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ That's *exactly* it. That's exactly it.

#### HARTRO

--but obvious-- that's obviously not--

#### DAVID

No that's not exactly it-- that's not it at all!

#### TREXEL

What, is it not?

#### DAVID

*Noo*, it's not at all! 'Cause Hartro is our *line manager* again...

#### HARTRO

##### [disappointed]

Yes, and you *are* right on one account, Trexel, [__TREXEL:__  Oh.] I will give you this one little tidbit check. Gold star, I am not reviewing your planets--

#### TREXEL

Excellent. You can leave. Leave the room.

#### HARTRO

##### [warningly]

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Please leave.

#### HARTRO

Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

I am staying, and I don't like that tone.

#### TREXEL

##### [choked up]

I'm sorry, Hartro, I just--  I just really got used to the idea that-- you'd never-- well, you know... *see me* again.

#### HARTRO

Well, get *un*used to the idea, because I am here. I am here to line manage, and to teach you... listen clearly... how to sale properly!

#### TREXEL

__*WHAT?!* __

#### HARTRO

Yes, I'm your sales training line manager.

#### TREXEL

This will-- I-- Who--

#### DAVID

Wait, but Trexel's training me.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning--consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

I'm a trained salesman!

#### HARTRO

What? Trexel's training you?

#### TREXEL

Trexel trained salesman!

#### DAVID

Yes, his-his-his ultimate guide to destroying sales.

#### HARTRO

What?

#### TREXEL

Ten Step Guide to Ultimate Sales Domination.

##### [cheerful jingle]

#### HARTRO

##### [coughs]

Okay, well this has not come too soon. Obviously, you need some guidance and I'm here to do that. [__TREXEL:__ Well-- ] Now David, you lucky, lucky clone. You do not have to take all of your information from Trexel. I'm here to appease your mind [__DAVID:__ Okay.] with some sales wisdom.

#### DAVID

It was mainly shouting and lying but it did seem to be working.

#### HARTRO

I can imagine.

#### TREXEL

David, do not impugn my system!

#### HARTRO

##### [chuckles]

We all know that I don't shout.

#### TREXEL

##### [sadly]

It's a good system.

#### HARTRO

So, today, for your special enjoyment, we will be doing some logic puzzles [__DAVID:__ Oh!] and some brain teasers!

#### DAVID

Oh, I like having my brain teased. [__HARTRO:__ Mm, yeah.] Instead of my body and spirit.

#### HARTRO

So, just to get us warmed up I'm just going to throw some ideas around, alright?

#### DAVID

Okay! Okay!

#### TREXEL

Is this a competition?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Oh, good. Okay.

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARTRO

One of you--

#### TREXEL

I'm back on board.

#### HARTRO

One of you will win.

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

What will we win? Uh, will it be access to the Cosmic Lounge again? Please, please, the drinks at the Astral Bar aren't f--

#### HARTRO

No. No, Trexel, that will-- that will never happen. You, you gave that up.

#### DAVID

For me!

#### HARTRO

Stop living in the past.

#### DAVID

For me. For David. Hello.

#### HARTRO

For-- for-- for a David.

#### TREXEL

##### [quietly]

Yes, I remember.

#### HARTRO

Okay. Imagine a clone, not unlike David, [__DAVID:__ Hello.] is tied to a four-meter-long rope. [__DAVID:__ Oh!] Okay?

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Alright, you imagining?

#### DAVID

I've never been tied to--

#### TREXEL

By what body part?

#### HARTRO

Let's say--

#### DAVID

Uh... *the knees*!

#### HARTRO

You want to be tied by the knees?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### HARTRO

Right, well then--

#### TREXEL

By the knees.

#### DAVID

Wait, I'm being tied by the knees? I thought this was a hypothetical thing. [__HARTRO:__ Sorry.] I don't want my hypothetical knees hypothetically tied!

#### HARTRO

Hypothetically, a clone, much like David but not David 7--

#### DAVID

David 8.

#### TREXEL

A Davalog.

#### HARTRO

David-- David 8. Okay.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

David 8 is tied by a four-meter-long rope and there is a *lovely* clone slurry. [__DAVID:__ Ooh! Mm!] Just, just twenty meters away from David. I mean, David 8.

#### DAVID

But wait a minute! The-- the rope's not long enough.

#### TREXEL

You're not going to be able to get to that slurry, David!

#### DAVID

No! No! That's impossible! It's impossible! I saw my knees off! I eat my kneecaps!

#### TREXEL

David! David, please!

#### HARTRO

How-how-however, however, listen. The David-- the David manages to get the slurry. Okay. How come? The timer has started. You can begin.

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### DAVID

Um... uh... slimed out of the rope because his knees are very... slippery.

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### TREXEL

Foolish. You can't get to the slime-- You've got to get to the slurry!

#### DAVID

No, I'm always slimy! That's my secret!

#### TREXEL

##### [quiz music grows distorted and fades out]

Oh, good point. But I think it is this: a kindly consultant named, let's say, Gexel Heistman,  goes and gets the clone slurry, and very kindly places it on the clone's face.

#### HARTRO

Oh. You-- Trexel, this is a side I haven't seen of you before. That you are kind, that you went and got the slurry--

#### TREXEL

Yep. Did I win? Have I won now?

#### HARTRO

No, because that's not the answer.

#### DAVID

Wait, wait, wait. Make the noise! Make the noise at him.

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### TREXEL

Argh!

#### DAVID

Yes! Yes! Yes!

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### TREXEL

I don't like it.

#### DAVID

Right, um--

#### HARTRO

That means you're wrong.

#### TREXEL

I understand.

#### DAVID

Okay, okay. My go now. My go now.

#### HARTRO

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

Oh!  Ten seconds left!

#### DAVID

Oh, oh, I-I bite through the rope.

#### HARTRO

Nope. Eh-eh.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### TREXEL

You fight through the rope.

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### TREXEL

You kite--

#### DAVID

You light up the rope!

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### TREXEL

You use a kite to kite the rope.

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### DAVID

I take sight of the rope.

#### HARTRO

Eh-eh.

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### TREXEL

Hike out of the rope!

##### [music stops]

#### HARTRO

##### [with emphasis]

Eh-eh!

##### [short 'lost a video game level' type tune]

#### DAVID

##### [word salad]

Oh no, the big eh-eh.

#### HARTRO

Whomp whomp whomp!

#### TREXEL

Okay, well this seems insulting.

#### HARTRO

I will train you. Okay. So, the rope... listen to it... is not tied to anything.

#### TREXEL

No!

#### HARTRO

It's not tied to--

#### DAVID

But it's tied to my knees!

#### HARTRO

To your knee but nothing else!

#### TREXEL

But not to an anchor point, David.

#### HARTRO

Do you see-- Okay, so--

#### DAVID

Oh, so I *hop* over to the clone slurry!

#### HARTRO

Yes, you can hop, you can run--

#### DAVID

And *gorge*!

#### HARTRO

You're not actually tied to anything!

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### HARTRO

So, this is what I want to get--

#### DAVID

That was a trick question. I didn't like that.

#### TREXEL

That was a trick question.

#### HARTRO

No. No. Eh-eh. Eh-eh.

##### [David and Trexel word salad]

#### HARTRO

No. No, this is just to show you that sometimes you create obstacles where there are none.

#### TREXEL

Is this designed to give us lateral brains?

#### DAVID

Did Trexel tie me up?

#### TREXEL

Did I tie him up?

#### HARTRO

##### [triumphant tone]

Okay, moving on. Probably. Yes. Right, so, uh, points to me for that one  because I made a very good point at the end but--

#### TREXEL

Wait, you can win?

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel groans]

I could win. Odds are I will win.

#### TREXEL

Did we find out what the prize was?

#### HARTRO

Lots of good things. Right, next. Imagine there are three cups of alcohol.

#### TREXEL

Yum yum yum, all gone!

#### HARTRO

No, Trexel. Imagine--

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### HARTRO

--that there are three cups--

#### TREXEL

Yum. Yum.

#### HARTRO

--of--

#### TREXEL

Yum!

#### HARTRO

--alcohol--

#### TREXEL

All gone.

#### HARTRO

--on the counter here.

#### TREXEL

Yum.

#### HARTRO

Right. And you take one--

#### TREXEL

Mm, it's gone.

#### HARTRO

--how many do you have?

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### TREXEL

Uh, all three.

##### [quiz music distorts]

#### DAVID

Two.

##### [music stops]

#### TREXEL

I've had all three.

#### DAVID

There are two left. You took one.

#### TREXEL

No, I've had all three.

#### HARTRO

Eh-- I just want to look at David 7 and go "eh-eh."

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### DAVID

What? Wait!

#### HARTRO

I would like to look at Trexel and say... "eh-eh."

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### DAVID

But there were three--

#### TREXEL

And I drank them all.

#### DAVID

--and you took one.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

How many are left?

#### HARTRO

I'll repeat the question.

#### TREXEL

Say it again but slower... and with real alcohol.

#### DAVID

Uh, Trexel, please stop trying to drink the question.

##### [Trexel grumbles]

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel slurps]

##### [Trexel slurps]

If there are three cups of alcohol  [__DAVID:__ Yes?] on the counter and you take one away, [__TREXEL:__ Num num num.] how many do you have?

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### DAVID

One, because you took one.

##### [quiz music distorts and ends]

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### HARTRO

David 7!

#### TREXEL

No!

##### [triumphant tone]

#### DAVID

Points for David! Ding-ding! Ding-ding!

#### HARTRO

David, you won't be able to drink this but here's a cup of alcohol!

#### DAVID

<p style="font-size:10pt;"> Um, I will not--

#### TREXEL

Give that to me!!

#### DAVID

No, I'm not gonna touch it. It's not clone alcohol.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

##### [desperate]

Give it!  Please! Please, give it to me!

#### HARTRO

<p style="font-size:10pt;"> So, if--

#### DAVID

I will take a victory swig from the slurry tube.

##### [slurry pouring out of the tube, David slurping it up]

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

Well, as that, uh, lovely cup of alcohol is going unused perhaps it could come over to *these* lips.

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

##### [hissed]

Nonetheless-- No no no no.  That's David's.

#### DAVID

Yes, I'm going to put it on my bedside table.

##### [cup drops on table]

#### HARTRO

What he does with it is his own decision.

#### TREXEL

He's going to use it to bathe his wounds if he doesn't give it to me.

#### HARTRO

Right, I just need to grab something quickly over here.

##### [Trexel and David fight over the glass of alcohol, crunching glass]

#### TREXEL

##### [chewing the glass/alcohol, troubling laugh]

Tasty, tasty.

#### DAVID

You... you ate the glass.

#### TREXEL

*All* of the glass. Worth it.

#### HARTRO

##### [thump]

Alright. And here. In front of you, feast your eyes on this little-- little creation I've made.

#### TREXEL

What's that?

#### HARTRO

You can see clearly there's a river running through the middle of the diorama.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, did you make this?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Arts and crafts detected. Green is not a creative colour.

#### HARTRO

And there are two banks which grass is growing out--

#### DAVID

Each blade individually painted.

#### TREXEL

It's incredibly detailed.

#### HARTRO

Um...

#### DAVID

Are those *daisies*?

#### TREXEL

Is this just for us or do you just have this at home?

##### [beat]

#### HARTRO

Focusing on the training apparatus, you will see--

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Okay.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Okay. Oh, the water is so realistic.

#### HARTRO

--there are three little figurines here.

#### DAVID

There are fish in there.

#### HARTRO

I've got, um-- this is what--

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Those fish are moving!

#### HARTRO

--you may not have seen this, but this is a chicken, alright. This is a chicken.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

And over here we have a fox.

#### TREXEL

What's a fox?

#### HARTRO

Uh, it's a-- like a... dog.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

It's one of those.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, it's like a red dog with a tail. A red--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Oh, like a red dog. A red, pointy dog.

#### HARTRO

So, here's a red pointy dog.

#### TREXEL

Okay,

#### HARTRO

And here is, uh... grain. Which I believe it's-- that's for the chicken. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Chickens, well-- chickens like grain.

#### DAVID

Okay, so I give the grain to the chicken.

#### TREXEL

Chicken's well-fed. The chicken thanks you. Maybe the chicken invests in your *business* *enterprise*. You become rich with the chicken! But suddenly, the chicken thinks it's bigger than you, better than you, and it's full of space cocaine! You're banging on its hotel door! YOU GOTTA WAKE UP CHICKEN! WAKE UP! But it's too late. The chicken's already dead.

#### HARTRO

Alright, Trexel. Just-- a little bit of this water on your face--

#### TREXEL

Okay.

##### [a couple of water splashes]

#### HARTRO

--should help. Should just calm down.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Right. It's just a chicken. It's just chicken, food--

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Just a regular chicken that doesn't go on a bender.

#### HARTRO

Yes. It's just a regular chicken. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Lays an egg maybe occasionally. Maybe. Okay. You don't--

#### DAVID

Is it laying an egg now?

#### TREXEL

Is it laying an egg right now?

#### DAVID

Do I have an egg?

#### HARTRO

##### [sighs]

No--

#### TREXEL

Is the egg part of the equation?

#### DAVID

I throw the egg in the river and feed the fish!

##### [Hartro sighs]

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Wait, what's the point?

#### HARTRO

##### [sets chicken in diorama]

##### [one of the diorama figurines falls over]

I'm trying to say something. Could you just put-- Give me back the chicken. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] He belongs there.  And he's next to his grain. Right. Here's the thing,  you do not want the chicken next to the grain because chickens like grain. You do not want the fox next to the chicken [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] [__DAVID:__ Okay.] because the fox likes the chicken.

#### TREXEL

I've got it! Chuck--

#### DAVID

Like-- but *like*-*likes* the chicken, or...?

#### HARTRO

Oh! Oh! Oh! And there's a boat!

#### TREXEL

Oh, there's a boat?

#### HARTRO

##### [drops boat down]

Here. There's the boat.

#### DAVID

Oh, wow! A three-master!

#### TREXEL

I've got an idea.

#### HARTRO

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You put the--

#### HARTRO

Oh, wait, the-- And your time begins... now.

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### TREXEL

##### [quiz music grows distorted]

I've got it. You put the grain in the boat. You sail the boat down the river. The chicken remains on one side of the river, the fox on the other. And then there's just a thousand years of  light tension between the nations of chicken and fox.

#### DAVID

But wait. The chickens don't have any grain, so they immediately starve to death.

#### TREXEL

Well then, that's-- that's--

#### DAVID

And the fox doesn't have any chicken. So, everybody's dead which means there's no longer a problem.

##### [music gradually grows softer and ends]

#### TREXEL

The whole of the universe tends toward entropy and this is just one example of that. You are welcome. Ten points for me.

#### DAVID

What, and me.

#### TREXEL

No, I came up with the idea. You merely assisted, so five points for you, twenty points for me.

#### DAVID

Wait, no, hang on a minute, but you just--

#### TREXEL

Minus six points for David for ungratefulness.

#### HARTRO

Uh, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Uh, who gave you the points?

#### TREXEL

I--

#### HARTRO

Not-- No one.

#### TREXEL

--somewhat assume-- I somewhat assumed they were on the--

#### HARTRO

No, you're pointless.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well okay.

#### HARTRO

You're pointless. In many ways, you are pointless.

#### DAVID

Uh, speaking of points, what is the point of this exercise?

#### HARTRO

David!

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### HARTRO

Stop asking questions, that's the point of this exercise.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### HARTRO

Obviously, there's a--

#### TREXEL

Well then, I've done really well because I haven't made David ask any questions.

#### HARTRO

##### [short 'lost a video game level' type tune] [sounds of Hartro moving the figurines around]

Eh-eh. Okay, everybody loses once again.  Obviously, what you do is you put the chicken in the boat and they-- he goes over there. And he's not with that. And then this-- the fox comes and then you do that and then, obviously, everybody then-- everyone's on the other side.

#### DAVID

No, that didn't-- wait, no--

#### HARTRO

And then, and then that's done.

#### DAVID

But that didn't work.

#### HARTRO

And that's a point. That's two points for me.

#### TREXEL

Also, was the point--

#### HARTRO

Excuse me.

#### TREXEL

--to get them from one side to the other? That was never said.

#### HARTRO

That's what a boat does!

#### DAVID

But wait, can the chick--

#### HARTRO

##### [sighs]

Do--

#### DAVID

Can-- can I swim?

#### HARTRO

No, you're a clone.

#### TREXEL

Can the fox swim?

#### HARTRO

Is David the fox? I didn't say David was the fox.

#### DAVID

No, but you just get the fox to swing over. Does the grain float?

#### TREXEL

Good point.

#### HARTRO

Right, we're moving on. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] We're moving on. Obviously, th-there was a very clear sales point that I was making there about--

#### DAVID

Well, there were about six sails on that boat.

#### TREXEL

Six on that mast.

#### HARTRO

##### [distorted triumphant tone]

--and-- That's right. Six points to be made there that all are mine  so that's seven to me. Well done.

#### TREXEL

Can I keep this little boat?

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

That is for the winner.

#### TREXEL

But it sails my dreams.

#### HARTRO

Right, so, I'd like you to close your eyes.

#### DAVID

Uh, around Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I don't-- I can't.

#### HARTRO

I would like you to attempt to close your eyes.

#### TREXEL

Okay, here we go. Nope.

#### HARTRO

Alright.

#### TREXEL

Ahhh... no.

#### DAVID

You could just face a corner. I find that--

#### TREXEL

I could face a corner.

#### HARTRO

Yeah. Go stand in that corner.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay.

#### HARTRO

And, um--

#### DAVID

Okay, well with Trexel in the corner I'm more comfortable about closing my eyes.

#### HARTRO

Well good, David.

#### DAVID

So, um, here they go.

#### HARTRO

Alright.

#### DAVID

And closed.

#### HARTRO

You're in a room.

#### TREXEL

Yes, well that's obvious.

#### HARTRO

Shut up, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Facing the corner.

#### HARTRO

That was... Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### HARTRO

Sometimes do you think you could just close your mouth? In fact, do you think if you had an aid to help you close your mouth that you might just keep it closed sometimes.

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

I suppose that might keep it closed. I don't know if you--

#### DAVID

Oh! I have a sock I found.

##### [opens drawer]

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

That is-- that is fan-- Thank you, David.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Uh, no, I don't-- No, I don't think this is-- I--

#### HARTRO

Is this one of your socks?

#### DAVID

No, I just found it. I don't wear socks.

#### HARTRO

Oh. Oh.

#### TREXEL

You don't like socks, David.

#### DAVID

No. It's why I'm giving it away.

#### HARTRO

Oh. Well, David has a sock that he doesn't like--

#### TREXEL

Whose sock is this?!

#### DAVID

I don't know but I kept it in my *hate* drawer.

##### [closes drawer]

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled from hate sock being put in his mouth]

Oh, you have a hate drawer? I knew we shouldn't have given you a--

#### HARTRO

##### [muffled complaining from Trexel]

##### [voice deepens]

##### [Trexel muffled noises]

There we go. Right. So, Trexel with his hate sock in the corner over there faced away since you can't close your eyes, just face the wall. Okay, good. Now, I use my imagination voice.  Imagine you're in a room.  And in this room is-- David and Trexel are in the same room.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm. Okay.

#### HARTRO

There are three light switches in this room.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### HARTRO

Okay.

##### [Trexel makes muffled noises]

#### HARTRO

And they go to three light bulbs which are connected through electricity onto the other side of the wall. You see, the picture is there's a wall with three light switches. The electricity goes through to the other side of the wall where there are three light bulbs.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

Okay.

#### HARTRO

##### [deepens voice]

Now, I would like you to decide, in a moment, you are allowed to switch on and off the light switches however you like, but then you are going to go through the door to the other side of the wall, see the light bulbs indeed which are on the other side, and you have to determine which light switch belongs to which light bulb-- oh, sorry.  which light bulb.

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Your time has begun.

#### DAVID

Okay, so I'm going to open the door.

##### [Trexel makes muffled noises]

#### HARTRO

But-- Oh, oh! But you can only go through once.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

You see, you can't-- you can't like--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

#### DAVID

Okay, so I send Trexel through the door--

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

Huh?

#### DAVID

--and then as I turn on and off the light switches Trexel... shouts which of the lights are going on and off.

#### HARTRO

Yeah but Trexel--

#### TREXEL

##### [spits out the hate sock]

You'll never get the information out of me! I'm no snitch! You'll never get me to say-- All the lights! All of them are on!

#### DAVID

##### [shushes Trexel more]

No, you shush! You shush! Go--

##### [Trexel struggles as David puts the hate sock back in Trexel's mouth]

#### DAVID

Right, well that's Trexel dealt with.

##### [Trexel makes muffled outrage noises]

#### HARTRO

David, I'm very impressed!

#### DAVID

Thank you.

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel makes muffled outrage noises]

The way you shoved that hate sock in  was just real--

#### DAVID

Well, I'm just getting into the-the spirit of things. [__HARTRO:__ Yeah, yeah.] A bare room with a bare light bulb and somebody shouting about information, I mean, it just-- the mood overtook me.

#### HARTRO

So, you're saying you would use Trexel.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Ah! Interesting. That's not the correct answer but--

##### [Trexel muffled smug noises and laughing]

#### HARTRO

--I'm going to give you a point for it anyway.

##### [triumphant tone]

#### DAVID

Yay!

#### HARTRO

'Cause I like your initiative.

#### DAVID

Okay, good. Thank you.

#### HARTRO

Right. Trexel, would you like to come back?

#### TREXEL [muffled]

Mm?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, you can take-- I'll take it out.

##### [Trexel spits the hate sock out of his mouth]

#### HARTRO

That's disgusting.

#### TREXEL

Bleh!

#### HARTRO

Let's put that back in your hate drawer.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes. Yech!

##### [hate drawer opens and closes]

#### TREXEL

Hartro, I don't think it's appropriate to allow a clone to act like that to me.

#### HARTRO

Well, he did it in the spirit of sales. And when it's in the spirit of sales and it's for the team, I say, "yah, yah, yah."

#### DAVID

The spirit of sales compelled me.

#### HARTRO

Hm.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well I do respect the spirit of sales. It has guided me throughout my entire life and my every decision, so I will respect it in this case, but I, I wish to lodge my complaint.

#### HARTRO

Lodged.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Complaint ignored!

#### TREXEL

Okay, right. I've got an answer.

#### HARTRO

I-- for your last and final--

#### TREXEL

I-I have an answer to the-- to that question. I have an answer! I know, I know the answer!

#### HARTRO

No, no. David, David already came up with--

#### DAVID

I got-- I got the points.

#### HARTRO

--not the right answer but an an--

#### TREXEL

It was wrong! I have a right answer, I'm sure!

#### HARTRO

I've accepted David's.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

I've accepted David's answer. You should be happy. He's part of your team.

#### DAVID

I sold the answer to Hartro and, and--

#### HARTRO

And I bought it.

#### DAVID

--she bought it.

#### TREXEL

Well, I see what's happening here. Quite the duo. Quite, quite, quite the conspiracy of two.

#### HARTRO

Aw.

#### TREXEL

No, no, it's fine. It's fine. You're going to concoct-- If you're going to concoct these silly logic puzzles and questions and, even when David's wrong, you're going to give him the point. No, I understand.

#### DAVID

No, no, tell you what--

#### TREXEL

This is-- this is what's been happening *all my life! I'm a genius!* And people *conspire* against me!

#### DAVID

Well, tell you what, Trexel. If Hartro had one puzzle left, so-so if she gives it to you and I promise I'm not going to answer at all. So, all of those points are on the table for you.

#### TREXEL

Yes, okay, yes. Yes, that works for me. Okay.

#### HARTRO

And a little twist actually.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

This last one's for me. So, the two of *you* get to come up with a riddle for me. And if--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

I get to do-- I get to do the riddle all on my own. All on my own!

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Okay, so that means that I don't-- And, and you have to come up with the riddle on your own.

#### TREXEL

This is Trexel's time to shine.

#### DAVID

Trexel has to make a riddle.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

So, if I get it, then I win. And if I don't get it, you-you win. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Thus getting A pluses for the lesson.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so I've got to come up with a riddle right now that's both logical and you can't answer.

#### HARTRO

Yes. I'm--

#### TREXEL

I can do this. I-I can do this.

#### HARTRO

I'm just gonna go over in the corner here and take my--

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay.

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### TREXEL

Um... Uh...

#### DAVID

I-I'm gonna go lie down in bed and not do anything.

#### TREXEL

No, uh, no. David...

#### DAVID

'Cause I did promise. I promised to Trexel. I promised to Trexel--

#### TREXEL

##### [uncertain laugh]

__[____crosstalk____]__ Well...  Da-David.

#### DAVID

##### [fake snores]

--and I'm keeping my word. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, let's--] Here I go. Lying down. [__TREXEL:__ No, David.] Oop, now I am going to pretend to be asleep.

#### TREXEL

##### [desperate]

No, Da-- No, open your eyes, David. No, David, that's not real sleep.  Please. David, please, I need help!

#### DAVID

What?

##### [music distorts]

#### TREXEL

I need help, David. I can't do this on my own!

#### DAVID

##### [music fades out]

Okay. Well... what is it worth to you?

#### TREXEL

What-- what do you mean?

#### DAVID

I think I will help you if you give me three of your points.

#### TREXEL

But David I don't have any points. I'll be in minus three points.

#### DAVID

Then... riddle away.

##### [music resumes]

#### TREXEL

##### [exasperated noises]

Oh!

#### HARTRO

Alright, I'm ready! Here I am!

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers to David]

Okay, you can have them. You can have them. You can have them.

#### HARTRO

Try and stump the line manager.

#### TREXEL

##### [music stops]

##### [whispers to David]

Right, we've got one.  We've got one, haven't we, David? We've got a-- we've got a real humdinger,  because you promised.

#### DAVID

Um... wait, no but-- Okay, so-- and-and we're doing it now?

#### HARTRO

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers to David]

Right now, David.  You've got my three points now come up with a riddle.

#### DAVID

We're doing it *right* now.

#### TREXEL

That was the deal.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay. I am... slippery... and tasty. I have... two siblings but I am the only one who will talk to you. I am needed for your... sustenance. Who-who am I?

#### TREXEL

Good question. Who he? What be?

#### DAVID

W-w-what be?

#### HARTRO

Hmm.

#### DAVID

Oh, sorry. Time is ticking.

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### TREXEL

##### [softly]

Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock. Tick tock.

#### HARTRO

##### [chuckles]

##### [music stops]

You do have a spirit of fun in you.  I like being up against the *wall*. I like it when stuff's hard and it's tricky and I have to think. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. I'm gonna go with...  slurry.

#### DAVID

Eh-eh.

##### [short 'lost a video game level' type tune]

#### HARTRO

What? What?

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

How the mighty have fallen!

#### DAVID

I-I'll maybe give you half points because it's specifically clone slurry.

#### TREXEL

Oh, so close!

#### DAVID

I have two siblings, two siblings which are consultant slurry and manager slurry. So, I was specifically clone slurry.

#### HARTRO

I think you'll find actually, David 7, that when I said slurry, I was *looking* at your clone slurry tube. I did-- I was--

#### TREXEL

Oh, that seems like a technicality. Now, Hartro, please.

#### HARTRO

Trexel.

#### DAVID

It was not a *mime* answer competition. This was a *word* answer competition.

#### HARTRO

Oh, oh, oh--

#### TREXEL

Let's not be petty, Hartro. Admit when you've failed.

#### DAVID

But--

#### HARTRO

Now, I-I would if I had. And I have-- I hadn't. I was-- I was looking at the clone slurry machine and I--

#### DAVID

Well, tell you what.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

I like your ingenuity. Seventy-five percent of the points.

##### [triumphant tone]

#### TREXEL

Okay, David, we're getting a little bit-- that's, that's... that's a little bit--

#### HARTRO

I'll take it! I'll take it. I'll take it.

#### DAVID

Right. Sold!

#### HARTRO

Which means I am the winner!

##### [triumphant tone]

#### TREXEL

David, you fool!

#### DAVID

Yay! Wait--

#### HARTRO

I get the boat. I get the chicken. I get the--

#### TREXEL

David!

#### HARTRO

I get all of the river and the grasses.

#### TREXEL

Your generosity has cursed us, David! We could have had *all* the figurines! And we could have made a little diorama of our own! I'd have been the chicken! You'd have been the bag of grain! And the fox would have been my father because he always threatened to eat me!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cannibal fox father detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Uh, oh. Um, well, how about-- Could we keep the landscape?

#### TREXEL

Could we keep the landscape?

#### HARTRO

Hmm... David.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### HARTRO

You can keep the landscape.

#### DAVID

Yay!!!

#### TREXEL [upset]

Oh, for good-- Board it! Ah!

#### HARTRO

This is, this is nice. This is homework actually. This means that David can construct, along with you Trexel, some learning environment, some sales-like homework play, play around dioramas. This is great. Yeah, I'll leave that there with you, David.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, actually, in the time that I would spend working but actually waiting for Trexel, I could, I could maybe make you a Trexel chicken out of, of goo and slurry.

#### TREXEL

You'd do that?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Would you make a... fox father?

#### DAVID

I-I would. And a little boat for him not to sail away from Trexel chicken.

#### TREXEL

What about... what about a little bag of grain with a number 7 drawn on the side?

#### DAVID

Yes, I-I'll do that. Yes, that will give me something to do while I wait for you to turn up.

#### TREXEL

And then I can consume you, David. Peck by peck I will absorb your grainy soul until I have your [__DAVID:__ Wait, hang on a minute. Hang on a minute.] logical powers inside of me! Yum, yum, yum.

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

And do you see what I've done here. I've created a real team.

#### TREXEL

A delicious team, David.

#### HARTRO

So, I will see you--

#### DAVID

##### [anxious]

Yes, I feel so... good.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID [anxious for the rest of the conversation]

Yes, I feel so good about what's happened here.

#### HARTRO

Good. Yes.

#### DAVID

This is a really exciting and [__TREXEL:__ Peck. Peck.] positive develop... ment.

#### HARTRO

Happy to help. I'll see you two lovebirds in about five sessions, I believe.

#### DAVID [unsure]

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Happy sales.

#### DAVID [nervously]

Happy sales.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Goodbye, Hartro. [__DAVID:__ Umm...] Well, David. Quite the turn of events. You're quite the logical clone, aren't you? [__DAVID:__ Uh...] But you have revealed your delicious knowledge and I will have it. [__DAVID:__ Um, okay.] I will have it, David. I don't know how, but it involves me metaphorically eating you as if you are grain. [__DAVID:__ Uh...] I'm going to have to work up what that means from there, but I'm pretty sure it involves *eating something*.

#### DAVID

Okay. Maybe drinking something.

#### TREXEL

Could be. I'll go work it out. I'll see you later.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

##### [nervous laugh]

Okay, bye.  Oh, dear. Oh, no.
