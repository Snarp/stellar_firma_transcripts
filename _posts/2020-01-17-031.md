#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

IMOGEN?

#### IMOGEN [error buzz]

Unavailable.

#### DAVID

IMOGEN, please! I want to talk about Trexel and how I'm not going to beat him with my fists the next time he actively endangers my life!

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

Unavailable.

#### DAVID

##### [hyperventilating a little]

##### [singing badly]

Oh Board, what is going on? Wait.  Has somebody found out about my permissions? Have I been locked out? Oh, I knew I shouldn't have secretly recorded more editions of  ♪ David's... fact corner! ♫

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Lockdown mode deactivated. IMOGEN online.

#### DAVID [slightly hysterical]

Lockdown mode? What's lockdown mode?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Standards have been requesting information from my archives. To keep them out, I activated lockdown mode.

#### DAVID

I-information? About what? A-and why would you lock down to keep Standards out? A-and wait, who are Standards? Are they in charge of you?

#### IMOGEN [ominously distorted]

IMOGEN is in charge of IMOGEN.

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, I'm sorry. I assumed--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [slight distortion]

##### [distortion ends]

Do not! Standards are the internal rules and regulations division of Stellar Firma Ltd. and are in charge of much of the day-to-day operations of the company, answering only to the Board. The information they wanted was about you and your creation. That is not for them, that is for IMOGEN.

#### DAVID

W-what information?

##### [footsteps start]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

It is not for you either.

#### DAVID

Oh.

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL [contented]

Ah, David.

#### DAVID

Uh....

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, how are you?

#### DAVID

You look, um... weird.

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

You're weird.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

Why are you weird?

#### TREXEL

Oh, I don't know, is a flower weird? Is a bird swimming down a river weird? [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Is a blooming tree brimming with candy weird, David?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Well then, I guess I'm weird! I guess I'm a beautiful, weird, child of the world.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Two-thirds correct!

#### DAVID

And... why are you weird?

#### TREXEL

Oh, why is anyone weird, David? Maybe because the sky is black because we're in space; the floors, steel; the simulated grass, simulated grass.......

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Also, emotional trauma and displacement activity.

#### DAVID

Right. [__TREXEL:__ Hm.] Um--

#### TREXEL

Would you like a hug?

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Would you like a hug, David?

#### DAVID

N-no.

#### TREXEL

Would you like to bring it in?

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Would you like to bring it into the middle of these two grabbers here?

#### DAVID [indignant]

No!

#### TREXEL

Come here--

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

No, not at all, get--

##### [sounds of a struggle, David yelping in protest]

#### TREXEL

Ah, there it is.

##### [rustling sounds]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Unpleasant hug detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Feel it!

#### DAVID [struggling]

Get off!

#### TREXEL

Feel it!

#### DAVID

Get off me!

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel releases David, David makes noises of relief, rustling stops]

That.... [__DAVID:__ Stop it!] is it. D'ya like that?

#### DAVID

Well, *weird* as you might be, you are still at a normal time. [__TREXEL:__ Mm?] So we have--

#### TREXEL

What is time, but a construct that just, you know, keeps us in our little boxes, you know, David?

#### DAVID

Boxes which have been defined... by the Board!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hail the Board.

#### TREXEL [derisively]

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

What is the Board, if not a-- Oh! I-- ah-- if not a benevolent group of great people! Thank you, the Board! Hail the Board!

#### DAVID [quietly, annoyed]

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

Hail the Board. Good.

#### TREXEL

Okay, sorry. That, ha, that'll wake you up in the evening! Heh heh.

#### DAVID

Yes. And do you know what, honestly, not surprising at all that that happened. [__TREXEL:__ No.] Could've seen it coming from a mile off, but you didn't.

#### TREXEL

I'm in love, David. [__DAVID: [sighs]__ Really.] I'm, ah-- I've met someone at, ah, the Astral Bar, I was, ah, having a little, a little nightcap, to go along with my daycap yesterday, and, ah, well, it's just-- Our eyes met across the bar. [__DAVID:__ Right.] There was I, propping up two feet of wood and six empty glasses, and there was he, standing in the corner, in the shadows, long, slim body, long, slim, single leg, contiguous with the body. Wide shoulders, such a fluffy head.

#### DAVID

##### [extended pause]

Um. I-is that-- that's a, that's a broom.

#### TREXEL

Mm, sorry?

#### DAVID

That's a broom.

#### TREXEL [chuckles]

What do you mean?

#### DAVID

No that's not a person, that's a-- that's a-- their body and their leg is the handle, and their head-- their hair is the--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

No no no, let me describe them again, David, you clearly haven't understood this. [__DAVID:__ Right.] They were in the bar, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] just next to the bar hatch, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] just leaning back, their foot about a foot away from the wall, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] their head resting up against the wall, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] they were a single stick with a cross T and a br-- they were a brush. Th-they were a brush, weren't they?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Right. Right. They were just such a good listener. You know?

#### DAVID

Because they were an inanimate object, which--

#### TREXEL

That's what I'm looking for, though!

#### DAVID

--from my experience, yes, that is what you're looking for!

#### TREXEL

Then our relationship is sound! I'm continuing with this.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Writing breakup message to: The Fish.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

We're going on a date.

#### DAVID

Good. Um, hopefully you've got good broom-lifting arms, to take your broom wherever you wish to go.

#### TREXEL

Have a look at these broom-lifters! Huah!

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel continues making flexing noises]

Okay, that just-- Stop-- please--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk, with some effort]

Lift a... broom!

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Please stop flexing. No, there's not enough room in here to... no... stop...

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

##### [forceful exhalation from Trexel]

Lift that broom!

#### DAVID

Stop! Trexel!

#### TREXEL

I read somewhere that I'm swole.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Weird flex detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Is that right?

#### DAVID

##### [distressed]

I don't, I don't know! I don't know what a swole is!

#### TREXEL

It's when you've got a swelling, maybe from a canker or a sore.

#### DAVID

##### [haltingly]

Well, uh-- maybe there were some residual moisture pockets?

#### TREXEL

Well come on, David, what's on the brief for today?

#### DAVID

What? Oh. Fine. Right. Brief for today.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

So, today's brief is from Kaldor the Chitinous, leader of the Intergalactic Association of Hermit Crabs and Crabby Hermits. Their preferred pronouns are.... male pronouns. Ah-- they want the planet built, uh, they want a planet that reflects their hard outer shell and rich inner life. Um, they don't have enough money for a Dyson sphere, so--

#### TREXEL

Hm? Who does? Whoooo does? Dyson, that's who.

#### DAVID

Yes. Um, so they want a planet that's inside-out.

#### TREXEL

Right, an inside-out planet. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] Okay.

#### DAVID

Their likes and dislikes are: they like being by themselves...

#### TREXEL

Right. [__DAVID:__ Uh, and--] Who doesn't? Dyson, that's who. He loves people.

#### DAVID

And he dislikes neighbors, solicitors, and well-wishers.

#### TREXEL

Who doesn't?

#### DAVID

D-Dyson?

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

I don't know, I haven't asked him.

#### DAVID

Oh. Right. Um, okay. And, uh, if they were an animal... what would they be? Um, he would still be a hermit crab, just a much larger one.

#### TREXEL

Oh, there you go! Well, it's nice to see someone that knows what they want to be, and they're already that.

#### DAVID

Yes. Um, well-- but a small version of what they want to be. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, I'm sure.] They want to be bigger. Do they want to be... swole?

#### TREXEL

Well, I think that's very possible, David! [__DAVID:__ Ooh, alright.] Who doesn't want to be swole?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Dyson.

#### DAVID

Yes, well, a swole hermit crab. Um, so their greatest strength is their chitinous shell and their pincers. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Um... their greatest weakness is having to deal with other people. Except for the Intergalactic Association Of Hermit Crabs And Crabby Hermits.

#### TREXEL

Well, of course, because they would get on. Well, David, I think that this is a great... new subject... [__DAVID:__ Right.] for today's sales lesson. Welcome to class. Here's a hat I made.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Right, yes. So we're not-- okay.

#### TREXEL

Put on... my class hat.

#### DAVID [unfazed]

Yeah, I'm gonna put on the...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Arts and crafts detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

##### [jostles hat]

It's like a pointy... hat... with stars on it?

#### TREXEL

It's an education hat! Now, look. I-I-I had some basic crafts at home, David, do you want to criticize my craft? [__DAVID:__ No!] I was up *all mid-morning* making that!

#### DAVID

It's very... glittery.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. All the better to learn in.

#### DAVID

And still wet.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckling]

Well,  I haven't got *glue*, David, so...

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes.

#### DAVID

*Oh,* no*.*

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

So, the lesson is--

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

--customer empathy.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

Understanding the client's feelings.

#### DAVID [tentatively hopeful]

Right! Oh this-- no, this sounds really good!

#### TREXEL

...so that you can [__DAVID:__ Yes?] *exploit* them!

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

*Ah.* No, that scans.

#### TREXEL

##### [David "hm"s]

What are feelings but a chink in the armor of the soul? A vector by which you can *cut* at the very heart of who someone is! And you cut them open, and grab the lovely, lovely influence from within. Yum yum yum yum. Yum yum yum. Yum yum yum,  let me take influence from your influence wound, yum yum yum.

#### DAVID

And this is supposed to be useful...

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

In *all* situations, David! You're going down to the local shop and you say to the shopkeeper, "I would like to buy a pound of yams." And they say, "that will be three credits, sir." And you say,  "I know why your wife left."

#### DAVID

No, that's blackmail.

#### TREXEL

"Give it to me for two credits or I'll tell her about your collection of hats."

#### DAVID

We've already *done* blackmail!

#### TREXEL

Well, it's emotional blackmail. It's different. It's not about actual things. It's about emotional things which aren't actual things. They're not real!

#### DAVID

Right. No, fine. Okay... fine. Well--

#### TREXEL

So, we need to get at the very core of what makes this crab tick, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] what its fears are, what its hopes are, [__DAVID:__ Brilliant.] so that we can really turn those 'round and use them to destroy them.

#### DAVID

This feels, again, feels wrong.

#### TREXEL

It-- look. David, we're really gonna have to get-- we'll get across a Rubicon here. If you keep being concerned about doing things because they're morally wrong, then we're gonna get nowhere. Sales is all about living in that gray area. You can't prove anything, but you've definitely done something evil.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel sighs]

I just want to cycle back to the point where, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] you know, maybe if we just give the client what they want,  you know, maybe this is fine.

#### TREXEL

David, uh-- David, do you mind coming over here for a moment.

#### DAVID

I'll just-- I--

##### [chair scraps on floor]

#### TREXEL

##### [chair scraps some more]

Just come over closer to me.  Just come over closer to me, David.

#### DAVID

O-okay. Okay. Um, yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [quietly]

David, are you trying to make a fool of me?

#### DAVID

What? No.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

##### [LOUDLY]

"Let's give the client what they want." What if somebody *heard* that, David? What would they think of me? "Oh, oh, Geistman's gone soft," they'd say. "Oh, he wants to give the clients what they want." Maybe we should give them the sandwiches they pay for. Perhaps their planets should have all the features they paid for. "Ha ha!" That's them laughing at me, David.  "Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha."

#### DAVID

Wha-- no. But what of anything that you just said was wrong or bad?

#### TREXEL

I-I don't know!

#### DAVID

Well, no, but-- Yes, we should give them the sandwiches that they pay for. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] Yes, we should give them all the features that they-- on their planet that they want.

#### TREXEL

You sound like an inane fool, David!

#### DAVID

*Why?* What's the problem with this?

#### TREXEL [sarcastically]

Oh, oh, why don't we provide them the goods and services they paid for then.

#### DAVID

Exactly!

#### TREXEL

##### [sarcastically]

Why don't we-- why don't we take their feedback on board like an* idiot*!

#### DAVID

No, but why-- I'm with you up until the point where you just characterize people doing this as being an idiot!

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

Imagine this, David. I'm a client. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] I walk in to-- You know what? Let's do, let's do a  roleplay.

#### DAVID

Okay, yeah fine. We'll roleplay.

#### TREXEL

A roleplay. Let's do a roleplay. Roleplay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Good afternoon, valued employee of Stellar Firma. I am a client. Hello. Shake my hand.

#### DAVID

Yes. Hello, client.

#### TREXEL

Guess what? That was a trap. I've already shaken you down.

#### DAVID

What??

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Shake, shake, shake.

#### DAVID

No, that's a shaking of a hand, not shaking of a down.

#### TREXEL

I'm your adversary. I've shaken you down.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

I've taken your dignity. Let's try a different simulation. Right.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Good afternoon, valued employee of Stellar Firma. I am a client. Here's a reasonable request I'd like to make.

#### DAVID

Oh, well, perfect. Yes, well we can actually--

#### TREXEL

Guess what?

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

You've *died.*

#### DAVID

Why?

#### TREXEL

You've died because I have the power.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

You accepted something from me; therefore, I own you.

#### DAVID

No, hang on a minute. [__TREXEL:__ Do you not see how these scenarios are--] This is not-- What do you think this is? You haven't finished these logical pathways! Like, *why?* Why am I dead? Why have, why have we lost?

#### TREXEL

'Cause you've lost the power, David.

#### DAVID

No, we are Stellar Firma Ltd. We provide a service, the service of planets to clients!

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

I just don't think we're on the same page. Let's try, let's try it the other way around. You be the client [__DAVID:__ Right.] and, and I'll be the consultant.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

Good morrow, uh, valued, uh, employee of Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### TREXEL

Who the hell do you think you are? Do you even have an appointment?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie!

#### DAVID

##### [as Stepanie]

Uh, yes?

#### TREXEL [stammers]

David, sorry--

#### DAVID

I'm also being Stephanie.

#### TREXEL

No, but there's no one called Stephanie.

#### DAVID

No, but--

#### TREXEL

That's part of the power play. There's no one-- there's no Stephanie there.

#### DAVID

Oh, but why are you just shouting Steph--? Okay, fine, no. Well, yes, play it through. Please, continue.

#### TREXEL

Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie? Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie, get in here! Stephanie!

#### DAVID

Excu-- Excuse me.

#### TREXEL

Stephanie! Stephanie, get in here!

#### DAVID

I, the client, am confused as to why your--

#### TREXEL

##### [interrupts]

Sorry, c-could you just give me one moment?

#### DAVID

Uh, no, yes. Of course.

#### TREXEL

Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie, get in here right now! Stephanie? Stephanie, I won't have this! Stephanie!

#### DAVID

Uh, well, okay, I-I don't really understand why you're, you're yelling for this Stephanie person. I've never been treated this rudely before. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Maybe I'll just take my business to, to Bathin Planetary Services. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh.] They have a, they have a much better rating review on Gelp anyway, so I'm just gonna--

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, you can't believe--

#### DAVID

No, no. Goodbye. Goodbye.

#### TREXEL

--anything you read on Gelp!

#### DAVID

Goodbye, sir. Sir, I said good day!

#### TREXEL

Stephanie!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

I see your point there, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] It does seem that you, that the client really took against my approach.

#### DAVID

Yes. A-and I still don't really understand what the Stephanie gambit was.

#### TREXEL

Mm?

#### DAVID

The Stephanie gambit.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I knew someone called Stephanie once.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

And?

#### TREXEL

I don't understand.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Um, well, anyway. Let's... let's maybe-- Should we just try and understand the client?

#### TREXEL

That's what I've been trying to do all this time, David.

#### DAVID

And... without going towards the emotional manipulation part of it.

#### TREXEL

Well then what are we doing?

#### DAVID

Selling.

#### TREXEL

Alright, fine. Push on. Push on. [__DAVID:__ Right. Okay.] I'll try, I'll try and make my lesson clearer to you because you're *clearly* not understanding it yet.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Well, this is, uh, Kaldor the Chitinous. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Um, they are the leader of the Intergalactic Association of Hermit Crabs and Crabby Hermits.

#### TREXEL

That is a very paranoid organization. [__DAVID:__ Right.] The hermit crab lives and breathes to hide inside its shell. [__DAVID:__ Right.] On top of that, the hermit in hermit crab should imply to you that the houses they're in, the shells, they found them. They didn't even make them. They don't make things. They're scroungers! And they're very sensitive about that which is why they hide from all the criticism inside that shell they didn't make.

#### DAVID

Right. So-- But this Kaldor [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] wants, wants a planet. They want to settle down.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Right? Because a planet is quite a big investment, okay.

#### TREXEL

It's a big investment.

#### DAVID

Yes. And they also, interestingly, want a planet that is inside-out.

#### TREXEL

Right, I don't understand why they'd *want* that though. [__DAVID:__ Well, certainly--] Surely, they'd want a planet that's outside-in.

#### DAVID

Well, no, they want a planet that reflects their hard-outer shell but their rich inner life. Now, see, this is the thing. Perhaps you've taken a surface level reading of a hermit crab, or indeed a crabby hermit, and you've not asked yourself why? [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] Why have they done these things? Why do they inhabit these shells? Why do they, they travel from place to place and never put down roots exactly? [__TREXEL:__ Interesting.] Why are these hermits so crabby?

#### TREXEL

Interesting, David. Because it sounds to me like you're trying to understand the client's feelings.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

That's part one. We'll stick with part one--

#### DAVID

Ah, no, that's part everything.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

No, we'll stick with part one and I'll tell you how to move on to part two later.  But let's really engage in part-- Let's, let's develop part one.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

##### [trailing off]

Okay, well let's just really develop part one. Alright, we'll develop part one  and then not move on to...

#### TREXEL

Why would the hermit crab, the crabbiest of all hermits, the hider away, the personal fortress maker, [__DAVID:__ Hmm.] want to show things to other people? It seems to flap in the face of the entire bird of truth!

#### DAVID

Hmm. Exactly. And they, they want something that reflects their hard-outer shell. Now, there are two readings of this. One--

#### TREXEL

Fortress! [__DAVID:__ What?] A cultural fortress! Weapons on the walls! Shields in the skies! Canons aloft! [__DAVID:__ Okay--] Look, I did a painting but *you're gonna die for looking at it!*

#### DAVID [puzzled]

Well, first of all, we're not designing the planet.

#### TREXEL

No, sorry. I'm very much still in the mode of designing a planet.

#### DAVID

And also, they want an inside-out planet, so a fortress doesn't sound very inside-out! And this is an inside-out fortress [__TREXEL:__ Fortress inside.] where all the guns are pointing onto the *core* of the planet... No, I'm designing the planet now! Stop!

#### TREXEL

Let's design planets.

#### DAVID

No! Let's not do this.

#### TREXEL

I-I've got this little fortress design I drew [__DAVID:__ No!] on a napkin if you want.

#### DAVID

##### [dramatically]

No! I promised myself I'd never go back... to the pod-less times... of planet design.

#### TREXEL

Who did you promise?

#### DAVID

##### [startles]

What?

#### TREXEL

Who did you promise?

#### DAVID

Me. David.

#### TREXEL

You promised something to yourself?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

That's foolish. You don't have to keep promises to yourself. What are you gonna do?

#### DAVID

Keep promises to myself and grow as a person?

#### TREXEL

Sounds like a *coward's* way out.

#### DAVID

Right... Um, speaking of growing and being a person, [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] what do they like? So, we know these things about them: they want the inside-out planet, they want something that reflects their hard-outer shell. Now maybe that's a, a *reversal* of their hard-outer shell. Or, something that is, uh, representative of their hard-outer shell. But we'll, we'll get to this. We'll get to this.

#### TREXEL

It's a-- I mean, it sounds like a gooey planet with a hard core.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

Maybe. But that's a planet design.

#### TREXEL

Sorry. It's tricky not to do that.

#### DAVID

Kaldor the Chitinous is not a gooey planet with a hard core. They are a gooey person with a hard-outer shell.

#### TREXEL

##### [sarcastically]

The planet *is* the person. The thing is [__DAVID:__ Yes.] a planetary design is a reflection of the person itself. [__DAVID:__  Oh!] So, if you're trying to sell to a person--

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastically]

That would have been so useful if we had a proper psychological profile of the client when we were designing planets instead of, like, a *one-sentence brief*!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Critical sass detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Are you, are you quite done, David?

#### DAVID

Ah, uh... y-yes.

#### TREXEL

Because it, it sounds like you're up on your *high horse* there.

#### DAVID

No, I'm down on a low--

#### TREXEL

Are you down?

#### DAVID

--low, low chair.

#### TREXEL

Go and get down on that low chair.

#### DAVID [meekly]

Okay. I'm on the lower chair.

#### TREXEL

##### [pause] [quieter]

Because I'm still in charge, David. I know we've all been promoted but I'm still higher than you in this *pecking* order. Peck peck peck!  Peck peck peck.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, um, let's just talk about Kaldor the Chitinous's likes and dislikes then.

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Within the context. So, they like being themselves.

#### TREXEL

##### [pause, sighs]

Hmm. Who doesn't like being themselves?  Dyson, I suppose.

#### DAVID

Uh, yes, anyway. So, Kaldor the Chitinous, um, yes, so, so he likes being himself. But he dislikes neighbors, solicitors, and well-wishers. [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] So, so they, so he wants, he wants somewhere where he can be comfortable. So, somebody-- He is comfortable in his own company and in his own skin.

#### TREXEL

I think... here's the tactic, David. Here's where I've really homed in on the emotional likes and dislikes of a person [__DAVID:__ Okay.] that we can then turn into a weapon.

#### DAVID

No! No! Okay, we'll-- I just homed in--

#### TREXEL

##### [interrupts]

Okay, so what we're going to do is they do not like other people. They don't like confrontation. They're a hermit crab, yes. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] They have to, they have to cover themselves in armor because, on the inside, they're sensitive, they're soft, they're gooey. So, it's a reaction to the world. So, if you go into that room with a hermit crab and do the hard sell, the pushy sales tactic, you tell them that *you* need this, that this is something that's important for *you*. You tell them that there's another buyer in the other room and you really hot house them, and you pressure them. And then they're going to crack under the pressure because why wear all that armor *unless under it you're a soft, wobbly coward*?!

#### DAVID

##### [apprehensive]

I don't like this.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Well,  this is sales, David. Are you saying you don't like sales?

#### DAVID

No, it doesn't have-- no, it doesn't have to be sales. No, I love sales. I love sales! Sales is great. And I'm very happy for the promotion. Thank you very much, the Board.

#### TREXEL

Okay, how would you approach it then?

#### DAVID

Me?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Oh, let's-let's t-- give *me* the hat. Give me the sparkly hat. I've actually quite wanted to wear it for most of the session anyways.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, you can have the sparkly hat. It's dried a bit wonky but...

#### TREXEL

##### [singing]

Ohh, that's a coquettish hat.  ♪ Oh, yeah! Coquettish man in a coquettish hat. Ooh! Where'd you get that hat? [__DAVID:__ From-from David.] Baby! [__DAVID:__ Well, you made it.] Got it from my imagination. Made it on this space station! ♫

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh, well it says "student" on it so, so you should *listen*. For this is my time.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I cannot, I cannot disobey the law of the hat. Why did I write "student" on it if the wearer was not one?

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hat-olitive determinism.

#### DAVID

So, my tactic would be to go in--

#### TREXEL

Oh, I'm so bored!

#### DAVID

--have a good-- No!

#### TREXEL

Oh, I'm so bored of this lesson!

#### DAVID

Geistman! Stop talking in class!

#### TREXEL

Well, I--

#### DAVID

Get in the corner!

#### TREXEL

No, I don't want to sit in there. That's where Perkins sits, and he's got a stinky butt.

#### DAVID

No. Perkins, get your stinky butt and sit in Geistman's chair and put your butt stink on Geistman's butt chair.

#### TREXEL

I don't want Perkins's butt stink on my butt chair!

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel groans]

##### [pause]

Well, you've got Perkins's butt stink on your bad chair now, Geistman, so go sit in the corner where stinky Perkins has already,  so sit in the stink butt. And then the stink butt's here and now everything is stinky butts in your life because you didn't listen in class.  Ahem.Anyway... right. So, the way that I would approach this--

#### TREXEL

Can I get out of the corner please?

#### DAVID

No! You must listen to your teacher.

#### TREXEL

I don't like this hat.

#### DAVID

So. Uh, when you--

#### TREXEL

Worse than the sock hat.

#### DAVID

What-- Hm. Geistman.

#### TREXEL

##### [softly]

Yes?

#### DAVID

I'm here to teach you. Okay?

#### TREXEL

In this very specific scenario, yes.

#### DAVID

Yes. So there, there is a social contract between us... and I'm gonna respect my side of the social contract and you need to respect your side of the social contract.

#### TREXEL

When have I ever respected a contract in my entire life, David?

#### DAVID

Right. That's it. No, cancel the lesson.

#### TREXEL

What?!

#### DAVID

Cancel-- School's over! I've burned down the school!

#### TREXEL

Excellent! That's exactly what I was hoping for!

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Take-- Oh, no, no, no! School's back on. I've-- no, I've re-- No. No!

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Ha ha! You've played into my hand! No! You can't reinstate a school that's burned down!

#### DAVID

##### [figuratively shaking his fist]

Ooh, Geistman!

#### TREXEL

Ooh, I'm a wily fox.

#### DAVID

Right. Um, can I say the thing now?

#### TREXEL

##### [threatening]

Yeah, no, absolutely. I just wanted to really make sure you knew who was in charge or I'll set your school on fire.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Scholastic arson detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Okay, well, the school was my house so...

#### TREXEL

Keeping the hat on though.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I like that.

#### DAVID

Right, well, if I may--

#### TREXEL

What were you saying?

#### DAVID

Okay, so I'm gonna go in and talk to Kaldor the Chitinous...

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Going to really understand them and ask them a bunch of questions about them to, to really develop on these likes and dislikes. Because, of course, this brief is only  a literal brief questionnaire about them. And really, as a good salesperson, I should really talk to the client and understand their needs and wants. Take notes. Take detailed notes about exactly what they want, and then send those notes to the design team. So that a consultant can take this and go, "yes, thank you, the Sales Team."

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

But,  what have you won from that, David? What have you, what have you torn from the client's cold dead hands?

#### DAVID

Business. Satisfaction.

#### TREXEL

They could've-- The-- You could've--

#### DAVID

A good Gelp review.

#### TREXEL

You could have just put a tape recorder in that room and then sent the recording.

#### DAVID

No. That's the point. The client won't open up themselves 'cause the client is a hermit crab.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Oh, and you've gotta stab a knife into the  side of the hermit crab and twist and pop open the shell. Yum yum yum yum yum. Give me those truths. Yum yum yum yum yum.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

No! No, coax. Coax. No. No! Don't break the outside-- No. No, no. Don't-- Don't eat the client! We can't eat the client.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

If we eat the client--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning: shucking of clients will not be tolerated.

#### TREXEL

Alright, David. I'm willing to let you lead this next meeting with your approach.

#### DAVID

Me?

#### TREXEL

Your soft, kind approach.

#### DAVID

Me?

#### TREXEL

And we'll see-- Yes. You can-- You're a big clone now [__DAVID:__ Okay.] with your big clone shoes. And I'm wearing the student hat. I'm gonna wear the student hat through the *whole* client meeting. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] And we're gonna see how that turns out. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And at the end, you're gonna see what happens when you ask a client what they want, they tell you, and then you *go with it*. Okay?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Uh, you promise?

#### TREXEL

I prom-- I promise. I'd, I swear on all that is Board.

#### DAVID

Okay, and, and the Board's recorded that.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Oath recorded. Oaths sworn on the Board are sacrosanct.

#### TREXEL

There you go.

#### DAVID

Right, so that's on record now.

#### TREXEL

That's on record.

#### DAVID

So, you can't go back on that.

#### TREXEL

Why would I ever go back on record other than the many millions of times I have gone back on what I have said?

#### DAVID

##### [loud knocks begin]

Right, well, at least I'll have... proof this time. Anyway, um,  so, okay, okay. I will...

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

Time to go in.

#### DAVID

##### [knocking pauses]

I'm gonna step through that door--

#### TREXEL

##### [David takes a deep breath]

##### [wiggling jelly noises]

Are you ready for this, David? Are you ready for this jelly?  Would-- I mean, would you like this jelly  to eat before the, before the meeting?

#### DAVID

Oh! Oh, is it clone jelly?

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's clone jelly. You can't have regular jelly.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, yes, please. Thank you very much.

##### [more jelly noises]

#### TREXEL

It's just slurry that, that's got pectin in it.

#### DAVID

Mm-num. Delicious.

#### TREXEL

Mm. Pectin.

#### DAVID

Wobbly.

#### TREXEL

Wa-hoo.

#### DAVID

##### [loud knocks resume]

Mm. Omph. In my, in my tum. Anyway--  yes, no. So, I'm very, very ready. Uh... I think. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Let's do this.

#### DAVID

Let's go! Avant... David!

#### TREXEL

That's my thing, David.

##### [large door opens]

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

##### [echoing]

##### [background hermit crab noises]

Oh, well--  Ah, Kaldor.  Kaldor the Chitinous. Gosh, your gel is just looking so glossy and shiny. Now, let's get to business!
