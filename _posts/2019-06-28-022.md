##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [voice gets louder and angrier]

##### [quieter]

Should I feel bad about this? No, no no *no*. He's an idiot and he could get me killed. I need to do this. But it is like tricking a baby. I mean, a big, sad, lonely, stinking,  loud, mean, stupid, murderous baby that has imprisoned me in this room and *might as well be a god*!  No, keep it together. Keep it together, David. Just-just stay the course. IMOGEN?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN online. How can I help you...

"__DAVID: [recorded]__ Um... David 7?"?

#### DAVID

Check design brief submissions. Umm, any alerts? Any... oh, I don't know, late notices?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

No abnormalities detected. If there were, you would be dead already.

#### DAVID

Right. Right. Thanks... I guess.

##### [footsteps]

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

David.

##### [David yells in surprise]

#### TREXEL

David, I'm bleeding.

#### DAVID

What? Trexel! What?

#### TREXEL

David, I am bleeding a little bit. Have you got any swabs, David, or perhaps some sort of handkerchief?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Well, there's this first aid kit there__--__

##### [error buzz, David being shocked]

#### IMOGEN

Access denied.

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Oh, it tased me.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Don't touch that. It's not for you. It's for me.

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Okay, well you get it.

##### [error buzz, Trexel being shocked]

#### IMOGEN

Access denied.

#### TREXEL

So, I__--__ That is a__--__ that is a line manager's first aid kit. Hang on, I'll get__--__

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

##### [whoosh of first aid compartment opening]

#### TREXEL

##### [opens kit]

##### [first aid kit being put back]

There it is. That's a consultant's first aid kit. So, let's just pop that open there.  Cotton swab, bandage, stem the flow. And there we go. All sorted. Pop that back up there.  How are you?

#### DAVID

Um, not bleeding.

#### TREXEL

No! Why not? Give it a go!

#### DAVID

No. I don't want to bleed, thank you. I mean, I'm sure I *can* bleed but I'd rather not find out.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Let's find out.

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ No! Let's not find out!

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Let's find out if you can bleed!

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ No! No, let's not find out!

#### TREXEL

Okay. Your funeral.

#### DAVID

No! Well, the oppo__--__

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Death is only permissible by order of The Board.

#### DAVID

Fine. We have another brief here.

#### TREXEL

You don't want to know *why* I was bleeding, David? You seem very uninterested in the *bleeding* of your immediate superior.

#### DAVID

Fine. Why were you bleeding, Trexel?

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ It's none of your business, David.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, time to get on with the__--__

#### TREXEL

But as you've asked, I've been gambling. I love a gamble, David! You know me. A man of chance. A man of odds. A man of action. A man *in* action. Actionable activity__--__ I've got lost, but the important thing__--__

#### DAVID

##### [under breath]

More like an odd chancer.

#### TREXEL

__--__Beg pardon?

#### DAVID

Sorry?

#### TREXEL

Sorry, what was that, David?

#### DAVID

Nothing.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, what was that, David? You had something to say there.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sass detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Uh, sounds like you're a real gambler.

#### TREXEL

Yes, a real hot dog gambler. And I might have ended up owing a little bit of money to people who were very, very cross when I didn't have the actual money, and they might have attacked me... with a bat. Now, this is part of gambling, David. You can't have a good night unless somebody's trying to make it your *last* night. That's what makes it fun.

#### DAVID

Right. That's the Trexel Geistman way, is it?

#### TREXEL

It's the Geistman way!

#### DAVID

Yes, well, speaking of the Geistman way, hopefully Geistman can make his way to the *brief* that we're doing.

#### TREXEL

Oh, good segue, David! Well segued.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Well, anyway, this one is from Bellonda Ghodrak.

#### TREXEL

Bellonda Ghodrak. What a lovely sounding name. Bellonda Ghodrak.

#### DAVID

Bellonda Ghodrak.

#### TREXEL

Bellonda...

__TREXEL and DAVID:__ --Ghodrak?

#### TREXEL

Bellonda Ghodrak.

#### DAVID

Bellonda Ghodrak.

#### TREXEL

It's both a question and an answer. It's a--

#### DAVID [playing with pronunciation]

Be-llonda Gho-drak.

#### TREXEL

Don't overwork it, David.

#### DAVID

Oh. Well...

#### TREXEL

Let's not, let's not overwork it into some sad dough.

#### DAVID

Alright, well, fine.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sad bread will not be permitted.

#### DAVID

Well, uh, they are asking, "Why do they want this planet built?" Ah, oh. Oh, speaking of sad dough, their home world was destroyed by invading space whales.

#### TREXEL

Oh no. How sad for them.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Beware the space whale, bringer of the end times.

#### DAVID

Yes. The one feature the design must have: their species cannot stand right angles.

#### TREXEL

Mmhmm.

#### DAVID [yelling]

"THERE CAN BE NO RIGHT ANGLES!"

#### TREXEL

Easy, David.

#### DAVID

But it was in caps.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, well, I understand but you--

#### DAVID

##### [yelling]

"BUT THERE CAN BE NO RIGHT ANGLES!"

#### TREXEL

You are not a slave to capitalization or punctuation, David.

#### DAVID

##### [yelling]

No, but it says right here, "My species can't stand right angles.  THERE CAN BE NO RIGHT ANGLES!"

#### TREXEL

##### [grabs paper]

David, give me that!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Unless you're going to behave with a capitalization and punctuation interpretation, thereof--

#### DAVID

Just trying to be true to the spirit of the brief.

#### TREXEL

##### [paper rustle]

Okay, well, I respect that. But I also hate that. Here's your brief back.  Play nicely.

#### DAVID

Right. Well.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so, their home world was destroyed by the space whales. Now, do you know much about the space whales, David?

#### DAVID

Uh, no. I've heard of Star Marlins. Are they anything to do with space whales?

#### TREXEL

Ahh. Interestingly you mentioned them because they have *everything* to do with space whales.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

They are the space whales' greatest enemy, the Star Marlin. In fact, most of the great events of the universe have been a juxtaposition between the order of the Star Marlin and the *chaos* of the space whale.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, so they're sort of a chaotic, space aquatic empire.

#### TREXEL

Yes, because a Star Marlin, more of a cartilaginous fish and a space whale, more of a mammal. And that always angers two species against each other. "Ooh, I spawn with eggs." "Ah, I give birth to live young and have a womb." You know, they're never going to get on.

#### DAVID

...Right.

#### TREXEL

And they never have.

#### DAVID

No. And it sounds like Bellonda Ghodrak has been caught up in this. Um--

#### TREXEL

Yes. They probably sided with a Star Marlin in some way. Maybe, maybe included them in one of their art exhibitions or perhaps signed a treaty.

#### DAVID

Maybe. I mean, they're not-- they aren't a Star Marlin, are they? Bellonda Ghodrak?

#### TREXEL

No! No no no no. No. The Star Marlin's a Star Marlin. It's a Star Marlin. Unless it's a Star Marlin, it's not a Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Right, so they're all called Star Marlin.

#### TREXEL

All called Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

They know who each other are. We know them as Star Marlin.

#### DAVID

Oh! Oh right, okay.

#### TREXEL

Whereas with space whales it's like, "Look, there's Chris, the space whale." "Oh look. Krillonya, the space whale." "Judith. She's a space whale." You know, it's-- it's a more simple system.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, it seems like their home world has been destroyed by... Judith. Umm--

#### TREXEL

We don't know if it *was* Judith! Could have been. Judith is vengeful. A vengeful space whale indeed. In fact, the entirety of this design, David, the entirety of this design has to be all about defense against space whales. Space whale me once, shame on you. Space whale me twice, shame on two. And then three comes along with a big bucket of shame and chucks it in your face.

##### [...]

#### DAVID

Okay. So, we're going to have to build a fortress without any right angles.

#### TREXEL

Yes. A curvy fortress. A sultry, curvy fortress. "Oh, trying to attack me. Trying to hit me with, perhaps, a flung comet. Oh, it's just *curving* off this space and out and into a sun."

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sexy architecture detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You can't hit what you can't measure with a right angle.

#### DAVID

...*Right*. So, we're starting off with a ball then?

#### TREXEL

Well, let-- let's not go straight to ball, David. I know we always tend towards balls because, you know, they naturally occur when gravity pulls particles into a central position and then *mashes* them into a thing. Y-- you end up with a ball nine times out of ten.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Perhaps more of an oblate spheroid. No, no, that's kind of nearly a ball anyway. Um, alright, alright, alright. An oblong. Sort of like a-- Have you ever seen, um, a sports ball?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

You've never, never seen a sports ball?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Well, it's like a sports ball. Sort of like pointy at two ends, roundish in the middle. You'll still call it a ball but if you try and roll it to someone, it just sort of waddles about like a *spheroid* idiot.

#### DAVID

Doesn't sound like a very good ball then.

#### TREXEL

It's a terrible ball but people still use them! I think it's for throwing or something. I don't know. I don't do sports. I watch them but only when I'm gambling on them and then the butt comes out and then *I'm sorry, I'm sorry*! And a fun night's had by all.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Well, I mean, you know, we could even design the-- the planet to look like a baseball bat, if you want.

#### TREXEL

Well, let's not get ridiculous, David. Design it like a baseball bat? Space whales *love* baseball! They'll spot that from an eon away. Eon's a measurement of time!

#### DAVID

Are they going to destroy it though?

#### TREXEL

I don't know.

#### DAVID

Would you destroy something you love?

#### TREXEL

##### [getting more and more emotional]

I destroy everything I love, David.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

Okay, no. Actually, back it--

#### TREXEL

I destroy everything I love! It's all ash in my mouth, David!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning! Consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

--I hold onto it and I grip it and it suffocates in my hands.

#### DAVID

Really should have seen that one coming.

#### TREXEL

##### [screams]

*Why?!*

#### DAVID

Are you done?

#### TREXEL [calm]

I am done.

#### DAVID

Good.

#### TREXEL

That was more of a contained one there.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Push it back down. Close the lid. Pop a lock on.

#### DAVID

Congratulations.

#### TREXEL

Thank you!

#### DAVID

Right. So, we've got a... sports ball shaped one. And-- and actually--

#### TREXEL

Yes. Torpedoid.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, the interesting thing is that they've specifically said right angles. That doesn't actually mean angles at all.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I suppose you're right.

#### DAVID

So, triangles.

#### TREXEL

We could have a triangle.

#### DAVID

Not a right-angle triangle, obviously.

#### TREXEL

So-- so-- so, you could-- you could have-- you can have an acute angle and you can have an obtuse angle.

#### DAVID

Yes. Maybe an octagon. A polyhedron.

#### TREXEL

A dodecahedron.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

A... *tri*decahedron.

#### DAVID

I suppose so.

#### TREXEL

A demispherahecadedron.

#### DAVID

Not even sure what that one is.

#### TREXEL

New shapes, David. Let's make shapes that defy the very laws of reality. "Try and look at this shape, moron! Your eyes have fallen off!"

#### DAVID

Okay. So, you've... you've been asked to design a planet and now you're trying to design a new shape?

#### TREXEL

You know, you're right David. I'm getting sidetracked. I do that. It's-- it's a symptom of the creative brain that I have. But you? You're my anchor. You're my rock. You bring me back down with your negativity and sad, sad eyes. So, let's-- let's ignore the new shapes things, David. [__DAVID:__ Well, let's--] Let's not get bogged down in new shapes.

#### DAVID

Let's build a pyramid then.

#### TREXEL

Let's build a pyramid! A sports pyramid!

##### [...]

#### DAVID

A sports pyramid?

#### TREXEL

We somehow decided on sports and we're going with it. It's a sports pyramid!

#### DAVID

Okay. A sports-- So some sort of big stadium?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

That's a planet?

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ No, hang on. Hang on, hang on, hang on.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Stadiums. Stadia. Stadfarms. We've been here, David. Let's not re-furrow old ground. That's already been furrowed! There's seeds in there, you idiot! Stop plowing up seeds!

#### DAVID

*You're* the one who brought up sports! And we were doing bloodsports there, so *you're* bringing up seeds! You need to unfurrow your farrows.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Agricultural sass detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay, David. Let's-- let's unfurrow.

#### DAVID

Alright, no sports.

#### TREXEL

No sports.

#### DAVID

No sports at all.

#### TREXEL

No sports.

#### DAVID

...Or gambling.

#### TREXEL

What do you mean "no gambling?"

#### DAVID

Gambling's a sport.

#### TREXEL

A sport? A sport?! It's a game of skill!

#### DAVID

Like sports.

#### TREXEL

##### [to himself]

##### [to David]

I suppose it is a little bit like sport.  So, you're saying that my gambling is, is fundamentally unoriginal and therefore for me to continue to gamble would, would make me an unoriginal person. Is that what you're saying, David?

#### DAVID

Yeah, why not.

#### TREXEL

God, you really needled me there, David. I love gambling and... and you've logic trapped me, David.

#### DAVID

Well, then you love sports.

#### TREXEL

You've put me in a logic trap.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Logic trap sprung. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____, screams]__ I'm in a logic trap! Please, free me! Free me! Can I have a cup to rattle about on the bars?

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Okay, it's not a physical trap. No. Stop climbing up on your chair! No. Get out of your chair!

#### TREXEL [yelling]

I need *water*!

#### DAVID

Just put your legs out!

#### TREXEL

* Justice!!*

#### DAVID

There's slurry over there!

#### TREXEL

*Justice!!*

#### DAVID

You can have it freely.

#### TREXEL

Are you releasing me from your logic prison, David?

#### DAVID

You put yourself there.

#### TREXEL

You're the logic jailer, David. You've got the logical key. [__DAVID:__ Well...] You've put me in here, David. This is your fault.

#### DAVID

Well, you're the one who didn't want sports!

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ Well, I'm in your logic prison! Ahh, help me!!

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Oh, fine. Alright! Well, we're allowed sports.

#### TREXEL

##### [deep breath]

Ahh, the logic freedom.  Ahh, the fresh air of logical freedom. Free to think. Free to feel. Free to do without the *fascist* David 7 telling me what my *mind* policeman should say.

#### DAVID

Yes, alright. You win. We'll build a stadium.

#### TREXEL

##### [excited]

We're building a stadium! That's what I always wanted.

#### DAVID

A big pyramid.

#### TREXEL

A big pyramid stadium dedicated entirely to gambling. A pyramid sports casino. Thank you, David. That's what we're doing. Right, so. Back to the brief. We're building a pyramid gambling stadium for sports. So, what do they want again? How do we word this into the thing that I want to do?

#### DAVID

Well, their home world was destroyed by space whales.

#### TREXEL

Space whales *abhor* gambling.

#### DAVID

Rights, so you want to use that to keep them away?

#### TREXEL

Yes. They'll be like, "Ooh, what's that? Is that something we can destroy? Aah, they're playing blackjack! Abort! Abort!"

#### DAVID

Okay, and they're definitely not going to follow up *that* thought with, "Let's destroy the place that has the thing we abhor in it."

#### TREXEL

No, because they have a certain kind of hate. Like a hate where you're like, "I don't even want to look at it. I won't even--"

#### DAVID

So, they're in denial about the gambling?

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

They're in denial about gambling! Because deep down, deep down, they want to gamble. They want to be on the blackjack table throwing those dice. And they're like, "That's a craps thing. You're on the blackjack table. Get out! Get out of the casino, Trexel! Get out from here!"

#### DAVID

Yes. Definitely *them* being in denial. So, is there anything else that they don't like? Anything that we can use to make this planet less attractive to the space whales?

#### TREXEL

Wat... Watercolors. Sort of like self-reflective poetry. Worlds with more than one moon. Don't know why. Never liked them. Uh, air conditioning. Not a fan. Think it's a waste of resources.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, obviously Trexel, these are all brilliant ideas. So, we should make it a pyramidal stadium [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] for gambling on sports and arts [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] and you can park your ship on one of the fifteen moons [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes, yes.] which are lit up in different colors. [__TREXEL:__ Obviously.] Umm--

#### TREXEL

And the whole thing. Climate controlled to the very Nth degree.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

Ahh, what temperature do you want it?

#### DAVID

At any temperature you want.

#### TREXEL

And everybody has their own personal temperature gauge. Maybe, you go in, you get your own personal temperature gauge belt, you pop it on, it keeps you the temperature you need to be. Because obviously we want this to be an intergalactic attraction. People need to maybe be really, really cold because they're from an ice, an ice world. Or someone needs to be hot because they're from an actual inside a star or maybe the core of a planet. The core of many planets is hotter than you would think, David. I know because, if you just keep digging, eventually, your shovel melts, and then *you* look like the idiot.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

##### [deep breath]

Yes. And also, the fact that you've got a lot of different species there from across the galaxy means that the space whales are less likely to destroy your planet because they're more likely to cause an international incident.

#### TREXEL

Yes! It's like a safe zone. Fill it with loads of nations, it's really difficult to decide who you want to kill.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Meat shields detected... Carry on.

#### DAVID

Sort of a Demilitarized Planet.

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes. But then you've got to be careful--

#### DAVID

Shut up, Trexel! Shut up! I've just realized!

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

A pyramid has *four* right angles. It's got a square at the bottom!

#### TREXEL

What?! What do you mean? Hang on. Look, hang on. I'm imagining a pyramid. It goes up. It's pointy at the top. None of them are right angles. And then there's a bit lower down. But it's on the floor so who cares!

#### DAVID

But what is the floor?

#### TREXEL

Of the pyramid?

#### DAVID

Walk to the core--

#### TREXEL

*It's a square, David*!

#### DAVID

Yes! Yes!

#### TREXEL

It's a square! There's four right angles there.

#### DAVID

Exactly. Look, you've worked out the shape. Well done.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Shape sass detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, okay. Tell you what. Make each one of those ninety-one degrees. Fine. Sorted. Each, each of the corners, ninety-one degrees. Absolutely fine. Absolutely sorted.

#### DAVID

I do feel like that's still going to *look* like a right angle.

#### TREXEL

No.

#### DAVID

And also cause a weird sort of dip in the floor.

#### TREXEL

No. No no no. Alright, fair enough. Ninety-four degrees. It's a little bit more obvious. It looks like a *choice*. If it's sort of a bit wrong, you're like, "Uhh, what happened there?" If it's *really* wrong, tell you what. Make it a hundred degrees. Each corner is a hundred degrees and then that, that *can't* be an accident. That's a design *choice*.

##### [...]

#### DAVID

Well, I'm pre--

#### TREXEL

Big, weird bendy walls. None of the actual corners line up. It's *impossible* to buy furnishings. You buy a sofa. You push it up against the wall. There's a weird bow behind it. And also, it wobbles on the third leg. And you-- you pack a napkin under there and you're like, "Well, I suppose that works for now." But the napkin gets stamped down by the *fat* *arses*

sitting on the sofa, hour after hour, looking at sports on-- on a holovid. And

they're gambling. And there-- there's sweat. And the sweat's getting into all of the furnishings. And they've become horrible and sort of fetid. And then you-- and then you realized one day you've been working for *thirty years* as a pit boss in an intergalactic casino full of *idiots*... So, we'll make those corners that shape.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, I'm pretty sure it's mathematically impossible but, no matter. I'll work it out later.

#### TREXEL

What do you mean? Sorry, what now?

#### DAVID

Sorry. What? I mean I'll work it out later as in this sentence. Trexel, it's mathematically impossible and we shouldn't do that.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. I hear what you say. What I hear is defeat. That's a defeatist attitude. Maths... is... our... minion.

#### DAVID

Could we just make it a cone?

#### TREXEL

Let's make it a cone. Make it a big circular bottom.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

You have to deal with it.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Thank goodness because I must say, I-- I was talking a big game about maths there. Maths kicks my butt every time. Nine-- nine times out of ten they're like, "Math doesn't work." And I'm like, "Sort it out." And they're like, "No, no, that's not how maths work. Your planet's exploded." So, let's make it a cone.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Good and--

#### TREXEL

And also, cone sort of sounds like clone. I don't think that's anything, but I think we should note it.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

It's not important. What else do we need to do?

#### DAVID

Where does Bellonda Ghodrak come from? And I sure hope they like gambling.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, I-- you know, I don't know a lot about Bellonda Ghodrak. Let-- let's just, a, look, uh, look them up. Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay. Alright. So here we go.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Client fact file: Bellonda Ghodrak.

#### DAVID

Poet laureate--

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

--for the arboreal world of 15-Î²Î¸ (Beta Theta).

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. This, this *may* be a problem, David.

#### DAVID

Hmm.

#### TREXEL

Um, that arboreal world? It's sort of a spiritual retreat planet.

#### DAVID

Well, it's not anymore. It's been blown up,

#### TREXEL

Alright, Negative Nigel. Yes, it *has* been blown up. But before it was blown up, it was a retreat planet for the Spiritually Cleansed.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

##### [screeches]

Not a big fan of gambling at the Spiritually Cleansed. They're normally like, "Repent, Trexel Geistman! Repent!" And I'm like, "No, thank you." And I'm trying to close the door but their-- their foot's in the door. And I'm slamming it. And their foot's bleeding now. And then there's a-- there's a bit of a foot in my house! What am I going to do with it then? What do I need-- I'm using it as a paperweight but it's starting to smell?

#### DAVID

Right. Well, I don't care *where* the foot is right now. We do not have time for that. I mean it explains the sort of-- the organic nature of the planet explains the dislike for right angles. Like, when do you see a right angle in the natural world?

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

Except for the cube trees but-- They're probably not even there! Actually, yeah. No, don't worry about it. We'll stick a bunch of trees on it. That'll be fine.

#### TREXEL

Exactly!

#### DAVID

Well, you know what, we'll let the* Build Team* handle it.

#### TREXEL

No. Da-- David. David, let's, let's not be... just, you know, blasÃ© about this. Let's not go back to our old ways and just let the Build Team sort it out.

#### DAVID

No, Trexel--

#### TREXEL

You had the, you had the idea there, David. You had the idea.

#### DAVID

Oh, stick trees on it?

#### TREXEL

Stick trees on it.

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### TREXEL

You put a, you put a croupiers table in there, put a tree in front of it. And you put the tree on like a little-- like a little track. Like a circular track that goes 'round the table. And then you put little sensors in it and then all of the actual-- the ultra-followers and-- and the Spiritually Cleansed, they've got little trackers on them. So, as they walk around, the trees trundle along, blocking their view, and allowing the actual gamblers to just get on with the act of gambling.

#### DAVID

So, what you're saying is we, we've built a planet for Bellonda

Ghodrak--

#### TREXEL

Yes. That is secretly also an intergalactic casino that we're funneling the profits from and everything is hidden by automatically adjusting trees that block their view of it.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Impractical fraud detected... Do better.

#### DAVID

You know what, Trexel. What a good idea.

#### TREXEL

What a good idea!

#### DAVID

I'm sure... the Build Team will love it.

#### TREXEL

I'm sure *I* love it and therefore *everyone* will love it because I am *absolutely* wonderful.

#### IMOGEN

##### [activation sound]

Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ Right. Well, that's lucky because-- Oh! Boop! There it goes. Off it goes.

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

#### IMOGEN

##### [clunk]

Submitting!

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ There it goes. Bye. Wheee! All the way through the tubes.

#### TREXEL

No. There was that noise again, David.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

What is that?

#### DAVID

Uh, it's probably something in the vents.

#### TREXEL

Something in the vents?

#### DAVID

You probably knocked something when you were in the vent.

#### TREXEL

Oh. Maybe I've let out some sort of a vent crawler.

#### DAVID

Yes, a vent crawler. Definitely a vent crawler.

#### TREXEL

Ah, well, I'll pop in there and have a look around and see if I can find it. H-- help me up onto the table.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. There we go.

##### [Trexel struggles onto the table]

#### TREXEL

There we are.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Vent unsealed.

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ Okay, David. Well, I'll-- I'll see you tomorrow.

##### [vent unsealing, mechanical whooshing]

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Unless I get lost in the vent system. In which case-- Eh, I'll see you when I see you.

#### DAVID

__[____crosstalk____]__ No. I'll just, I'll just-- Just slide you in here. Bye, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

##### [echoing]

Oh. Bye, David!

#### DAVID

Bye!

##### [vent being sealed back up]

#### DAVID

Right. Just wait for him to go.

##### [Trexel crawling through the vent]

##### [Trexel screams]

#### DAVID

And *there's* the scream. Okay, we're fine.
