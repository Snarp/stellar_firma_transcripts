##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [straining]

##### [footsteps approach]

Ninety-eight... Ninety-nine...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David, what are you doing?

#### DAVID

A hundred--

#### TREXEL

David, you're on the floor!

#### DAVID

Oh. One hundred and one...

#### TREXEL

David, you're pushing at the floor.

#### DAVID

One hundred and two!

#### TREXEL

Did the floor wrong you in some way?

#### DAVID

One hundred and three...

#### TREXEL

Do you need me to back you up and punch the floor?

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel starts punching the floor]

One hundred and four... and one hundred and five.

#### TREXEL

Ow, my fists hurt.

#### DAVID

Oh! Ah! The pleasing magic number of one hundred and five.

#### TREXEL

What were you doing, David?

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, I was doing body bench up downs.

#### TREXEL

What the-- A body bench up down?

#### DAVID

Yes. Uh, it's where you make your body into sort of a bench and then you go up and down on your arms.

#### TREXEL

For what reason?

#### DAVID

Um... I'm bored.

#### TREXEL

You're bored?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So you're on the-- David, is this exercise?!

#### DAVID

I think so.

#### TREXEL

I do not approve of exercise!

#### DAVID

Why not?

#### TREXEL

The swolening is not for the likes of us! We are cerebral creatures, David, and exercising is for the mentally weak!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Clone swolening detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

But my--

#### TREXEL [mocking]

Oh, I'm worried about thinking so I'm exhausting my muscles to coma!

#### DAVID

But my, my arms feel numb and my brain feels good.

#### TREXEL

David, the only possible reason to have your arms go numb and your brain feel good is because of the excessive consumption of ethanolated spirits!

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

This is not the true way, David! If you wish for mind annihilation there are better ways than swolenating.

#### DAVID

Okay, could I have some alcohol please?

#### TREXEL

Absolutely not! How dare you even ask! And anyway, why are you so bored?

#### DAVID

Well, I-- I can't access IMOGEN down here. There's no console! I can't do the beep beep bop bop. I can't--

#### TREXEL

Oh, just vocal commands.

#### DAVID

I don't even think that. I-- IMOGEN? Hello?

#### TREXEL

Well, that wasn't a command, David. That was just a call and response. Try something command-y.

#### DAVID

Um, IMOGEN? Hi!

#### TREXEL

No, David, no. That-- you are-- you are saying-- you're just-- Let me try. IMOGEN, could you please dispense a cup of slurry?

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

Slurry is for beings deemed of worth. Slurry denied.

#### TREXEL

Well that was a little bit rude, but fair enough. [__DAVID:__ Hmm.] Okay, well--

#### DAVID

So, she's kind of been like that all, um, all evening. She's not--

#### TREXEL

Sort of, sort of sassy and weird?

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

But, like, not-- not at all helpful?

#### DAVID

No. Well, she hasn't gun-walled me but, um--

#### TREXEL

No, that's true.

#### DAVID

Uh, yeah. Nothing--

#### TREXEL

##### [loudly]

Let's wa-- Maybe there-- maybe there aren't any gun walls, David. Maybe there aren't. The Board's a poop!

##### [sound of larger and more threatening guns unfolding, low tone beeping]

##### [Trexel and David yell in terror]

#### DAVID

Woah! Woah, those guns are bigger! They're bigger and there are more of them!

#### TREXEL

##### [panicked]

By which I meant, by which I meant, by which I meant all matter returns to itself and its fertilising, uh, properties allow us to grow because I love it! I love the Board! [__DAVID:__ Yes!] The Board is king!

##### [beeping stops, big guns disassembles and retracts]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Do not test me.

##### [David sighs in relief]

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. So--

#### DAVID

Those guns were bad!

#### TREXEL

That was what we call in the business of science, a science test.

#### DAVID

That made the guns in the other room seem positively genteel and polite.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

Bigger-- bigger guns. More frightening__. [David sighs]__ We thought-- our hypothesis: no guns. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Reality: yet more guns! [__DAVID:__ Mm. Hoo-hoo.] And I have noticed in this room, more than other rooms, there's more bullet holes.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

They tested.

#### DAVID

Yeah...

#### TREXEL

Anywho, so how have you been getting on with the silent, empty room with nothing to distract you, no bed, and just a sort of a wet floor with puddles?

#### DAVID

Uh, body bench upsy downsies.

#### TREXEL

Hmm. Hmm. Well, if it works for you, I suppose I'll allow it.

#### DAVID

Thank you!

#### TREXEL

Mainly because to not allow it I'd have to be here and pay attention and I've had plenty to do on my own!

#### DAVID

Yes, what have you been up to? Did you find your way back?

#### TREXEL

...Not as such.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, do you-- do you know where we are? Did you find that out?

#### TREXEL

David I'm gonna level with you. You know when I came in here and opened the door?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, I was still looking for my office and I just opened this door and you were here.

#### DAVID

That was twenty-three hours ago you left.

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

And you've just been wandering around for twenty-three hours?

#### TREXEL

I napped for a while in a corner.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But I have absolutely no idea where we are on the station. I can't find any transport links. Most of the offices just contain darkness and howling, so...

#### DAVID

Was there a sign? Did you see one sign?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, there was a sign.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

It said "no"...

#### DAVID

Just... just "no"?

#### TREXEL

It was on a door. It said no.

#### DAVID

Did you go through the door?

#### TREXEL

No!

#### DAVID

That is surprising, honestly.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Reasonable caution detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

David, you don't live for as long as I have, which is an amount of time, by just opening every door that says no.

#### DAVID

But I've never seen you do anything that--

#### TREXEL

You carve a small hole in the door and peep through to see what's happening!

#### DAVID

Okay, what did you see?

#### TREXEL

Fire.

#### DAVID

Just fire?

#### TREXEL

Just fire.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

That's why I've got such a *hot* eye.

#### DAVID

Yes. Oh, your eyebrow is still, uh-- Just let me--

#### TREXEL

##### [sizzle from fire being extinguished]

Don't-- No, no, leave it. Leave it. David, I'm saving that fire in case I need to start a fire later.

#### DAVID

No, I've slimed it out now.

#### TREXEL

Aww, I've got slime fire.

#### DAVID

Anyway, we still have a job to do. Can we, can we get on with the job?

#### TREXEL

What job?

#### DAVID

The-- expediting.

#### TREXEL

That's not a job.

#### DAVID

Well, I think it--

#### TREXEL

That's just a thing to do until you're dead.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

That is most things.

#### DAVID

...Trexel--

#### TREXEL

That's a job, isn't it?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well...

#### DAVID

You are an Expeditor, I am an Exped-sistant, and we're going to expedite--

#### TREXEL

Expeditrix.

#### DAVID

N--

#### TREXEL

Expeditette.

#### DAVID

Mm--

#### TREXEL

Ex-pah.

#### DAVID

Hm.

#### TREXEL

Ditty-boi. The Ditinator!

#### DAVID

The-- Okay, well you're the Ditinator.

#### TREXEL

D-dog.

#### DAVID

D-- Um, D-- Okay, um--

#### TREXEL

'Cause that works for David and the 'D' in Expeditor.

#### DAVID

Right, so you're--

#### TREXEL

I'm D-dog. I want to be D-dog.

#### DAVID

Uh, you can be D-dog--

#### TREXEL

I'm TD-dog.

#### DAVID

TD-dog.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ Look out! It's TD-dog. TD stands for "Trexel dominates". He's on the streets. He's commanding respect. Don't look at him 'cause he will flex because Trexel's the one that's allowed to be swole. David stop exercising, it hurts your soul. You use your mind. I also use my mind but my mind has muscles on the end of my arms. ♫

#### DAVID

Two things.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Are you dominating dogs?

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

Trexel dominates dogs.

#### TREXEL

No, I--

#### DAVID

That's what your name means, right? You're walking around commanding dogs.

#### TREXEL

Well, I mean dogs do command-- are commanded by me.

#### DAVID

##### [humour in his voice]

##### [the best laugh ever]

And number two, now I've started exercising, what are those on your shoulders? A couple of wet noodles? Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

#### TREXEL

Oh, I don't like this! I don't like this tone! Let's not body shame me.

#### DAVID

Okay, well--

#### TREXEL

I've already got enough going on up here!

#### DAVID

Right. Fine. Well, let's just look at the suggestion. Com-- complaining suggestion.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initiating.

##### [pneumatic tube seal breaks]

#### DAVID

##### [closes tube door]

Right. Um, we have one from... Doug Whimperton. Pronouns are he/him. He is from the Marketing department.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckle]

Oh, Marketing. I miss Marketing. I-- I got to sit in on Marketing meetings for a, a very entertaining week, and I think they took my ideas on board in that they had to clean the department from top to bottom with bleach.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

And burn all the chairs.

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh, right. So, their role in the Marketing department is, um, give me a second here, they are "an Assistant to the Assistant of the Sub Sub Undersecretary of the Secretary of the Director of Marketing, AASSUSSDM for short. *Wink."* Um, that's, that's on there. I didn't-- not wink--

#### TREXEL

Interesting.

#### DAVID

"Not long before I'll be running the whole damn show. Double wink."

#### TREXEL

Double wink. Double wink.

#### DAVID

Do-- do marketers always just express facial expressions?

#### TREXEL

Well, when you've been marketing for as long as Stellar Firma has, you run out of ideas pretty quick. Like two weeks in, our Marketing department was like, "Woah! I mean, buy planets. Beyond that what do you want from us?! They're good planets! Leave me alone!" Slam the door! Turn up the music real loud! Consider that music makes you sound pretty cool. Put the music in the adverts! People think the music is some sort of trite way of trying to curry favour with the younger generation. Alright, put old music on. Oh, now you're trying to get the old vote. You know, it's complicated!

#### DAVID

Right, so this has just been happening continuously since the beginning of Stellar Firma.

#### TREXEL

Pretty much. So we've got to the point now where mostly we're at sort of a really metaphysical stage where, in marketing terms, what we do is we explain images out loud to people and the images are what we're trying to convey to them but through the medium of explaining the facial expressions and hand movements of the people involved.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well that sounds good. Rolls my eyes sarcastically.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Clones are not permitted to work within the Marketing department. Their innate compassion gets in the way.

#### DAVID

Anyway, their suggest--

#### TREXEL

Stop right there.

#### DAVID

--ion...

#### TREXEL

Are you in marketing?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

You're an Expeditor now.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Lower than trash.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Do not-- 'cause I know what you're doing!

#### DAVID

Uh, no--

#### TREXEL

You did that as a sassy little response to me as if that was a bad thing. But what you did there was engage in the highest form of marketing and your sarcasm and your lack of respect for the people of marketing marks only as much as my own lack of respect for anyone is. That sentence meant nothing! I lost the handle on it pretty quickly, let me tell you! Turns away! Puts nose in air! Harrumphs.

#### DAVID

Uh... Tr-Trexel. Trexel, come back. Come back.

#### TREXEL

Harrumph!

#### DAVID

No! No, look--

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Consultant spiraling. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

We've gotta--

#### TREXEL

Rrumph-ha!

#### DAVID

We've got a suggestion. You're not Marketing. You're not consumed by Marketing. You're Expediting and here's the thing you need to expedite, okay?

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay.

#### DAVID

Right. So, uh, and I'm starting reading now, it's conversational. "Well you see--" And that was, that was them--

#### TREXEL

I understand.

#### DAVID

--not, not me. Um, "well you see, the iss--"

#### TREXEL

What do I see?

#### DAVID

Well-- I think what I'm gonna... explain now.

#### TREXEL

I'm Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

Okay, and I'm David 7--

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

--but I am speaking now as Doug Whimperton, basically--

#### TREXEL

Oh, hi Doug!

#### DAVID

Hello. Hello!

#### TREXEL

How's Marketing?

#### DAVID

"It's, it's nice. *Smile.* And I'm gonna explain-- well you see, the issue is with Daniel, the other AASSUSSDM here. We work as a pair doing the Board's work, really contributing to the whole marketing ecosystem here at Stellar Firma. It's just that his, uh, last name is also Whimperton [__TREXEL:__ Oh!] and we're always getting confused with each other by our boss, the ASSUSSDM. I've thought about rebranding myself, you know, retain the alpha Whimperton status but it's just not working. I'd like to log a complaint that the Board--All Hail the Board--"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Hail the Board.

#### TREXEL

Hail the Board.

#### DAVID

"--put two people with basically the same name in the same group with no hope of recognition." So it sounds like Doug Whimperton is probably already gone because they were suggesting that the Board did wrong.

#### TREXEL

It's very possible, David, and such, we should do nothing. Good day to you, sir.

#### DAVID

Uh, no. Hang on a minute.

#### TREXEL

Good day.

#### DAVID

No, there is--

#### TREXEL

I said, "good day".

#### DAVID

No, no, there is a bit--

#### TREXEL

It's a good day.

#### DAVID

No, there is the bit where--

#### TREXEL

We-may-not-have-night-and-day-cycles-but-a-good-one-to-you day.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel sighs]

The-- the walls will crush us. And the door is locked--

#### TREXEL

Is it?

#### DAVID

--until we submit something.

#### TREXEL

Hang on.

#### DAVID

Go on. Try it.

##### [Trexel tries unsuccessfully to open the door, error buzz]

#### TREXEL

That's a locked door.

#### DAVID

Do you wanna be crushed by walls?

#### TREXEL

##### [power drill noises]

I'm gonna drill a hole in it. A little peek through here. Ah, interesting. There's a sign outside saying, "Get to work!"

#### DAVID

Well, and we know what Trexel does with signs. He listens to them.

#### TREXEL

##### [agreeing noises]

I obey-- I obey signs.

#### DAVID

So... get to work!

#### TREXEL

Right, fine. Okay then. So, so let's boil this right down.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

There's Doug Whimperton.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Is there-- And then there's another Doug Whimperton.

#### DAVID

Well no, there's another "somebody" Whimperton. We don't have their first name.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

The problem is they also have the surname Whimperton.

#### TREXEL

I understand. And... as is the tradition of all managers anywhere, don't call people by their first name, yell their surname. David, if you had a surname I'd yell it.

#### DAVID

My surname is 7.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

What-- what, you just want me to yell *7*?

#### DAVID

Actually, no. Hang on a minute, my surname is-- no, no it's gotta be-- my surname is David!

#### TREXEL

No-- David, David, don't get too lost into this. Your name is David 7 [__DAVID:__ Yes.] but I'm not yelling 7 so your name is David. [__DAVID:__ No but--] You don't have a first name, you don't have a surname, you have a name and a designation.

#### DAVID

But my previous--

#### TREXEL

Name: David. Designation: 7.

#### DAVID

But-- but my previous David was David 6, right?

#### TREXEL

Name: David. Designation: 6. Yes.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

And that means-- so that's 6, yes? So I'm 7, that's my, my individual identifier, right? But David is sort of my... I suppose, line? And-- and your line, your parents were of the Geistman line, right? But to designate you as Trexel, you are called Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

So your first name is 7--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--and your surname is David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Which means I'm yelling David correctly. Which means I'm right--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I'm on board!

#### DAVID

Okay, right.

#### TREXEL

Well--

#### DAVID

All Hail the Board!

#### TREXEL

All Hail the Board.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Genealogical justification detected. Security reunited with lost relatives.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Okay well, so in your case, David. In their case *Whimperton!*

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

*Whimperton!*

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

*Whimperton get in here!* And two people walk in.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And that's-- that's a problem.

#### DAVID

One of them is Doug. I'm gonna call the other one--

#### TREXEL

Bloug.

#### DAVID

--Allison. What?

#### TREXEL

Bloug.

#### DAVID

Bloug?

#### TREXEL

Doug and Bloug.

#### DAVID

Bloug?

#### TREXEL

It's like Doug but Bloug.

#### DAVID

Okay. Bloug Whimperton.

#### TREXEL

So, how do you take care of the problems of the Whimpertons?

#### DAVID

Well Doug and Bloug, um, really-- I mean, there should only be one Whimperton, right?

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Oh, absolutely. There's one Geistman.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

None of the others have survived.

#### DAVID

Okay, well there you go. So that's exactly it, just kill the other Whimperton.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes!

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

Well, just-- just-- just off him.

#### TREXEL

Just kil-- just-- David!

#### DAVID

##### [yells at the top of his lungs]

You just say, "Excuse me Bloug, could you come and help me in this cupboard?" where I'm standing in front of the sign that says "airlock". [__TREXEL:__ Da-- Da-- David...] And then when they get in, [__TREXEL:__ No, David--] you just press the button and away you go Bloug! [__TREXEL:__ David--] * I am the only Whimperton!* [__TREXEL:__ David!] *It is I,* [__TREXEL:__ David!] *Doug Whimperton!*

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

I don't know how I feel about this line.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

##### [stammers]

##### [yells]

##### [calmer]

It-- that's-- It has been said that there have been murders and killings around which I have been-- let's say implicated. *Never confirmed!* Never confirmed. But implicated. And that's, that's an issue but that's me. You, on the other hand, have been a little bit more on the "hey, let's not murder" sort of train for a while and this isn't a--

#### DAVID

No, le-- "hey let's not murder *me*!"

#### TREXEL

Well-- well yes David, but you've been generally anti-murder as far as I'm aware.

#### DAVID

Yeah but life is-- Okay. All I'm learning, all I am learning over this whole time is that life on Stellar Firma is *cheap*, right? So if you want to get an easy solution to the problem just-- oh yeah, no this is it. Don't airlock him. Take Bloug and go, "Hey Bloug, I'm gonna arbitrary stick you in a blender and *blend* you up! And now I'm gonna *drink you*!"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Well this was bound to happen eventually.

#### DAVID

'Cause that's how Stellar Firma solves all of its problems.

#### TREXEL

Well, y-- yeah--

#### DAVID

So just do that!

#### TREXEL

David, you can't just do that though.

#### DAVID

Well you can.

#### TREXEL

Have you got the paperwork? Have you got the permissions? Have you got the communiqués?

#### DAVID

Okay, well start filling in your forms now.

#### TREXEL

Oh, you think we just have access to those forms?

#### DAVID

No, no, not-- No, Doug. Doug starts filling in those forms.

#### TREXEL

Oh, oh, oh, I-- I-- I went, I went, I went to the cafeteria, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and somebody cut in front of me in line, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] and then they just let me access the forms to have them liquidated? No! No, there will be three people left after a week. People irritate each other. You can't just willy-nilly kill people unless there's been some sort of drunken rage fugue state and it's just sort of happened!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Drunken fugue murder suspect list updated. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

I'm protected; you're not.

#### DAVID

Because you're full of alcohol?

#### TREXEL

No, because I'm full of privilege, which is kind of similar. You get drunk on it.

#### DAVID

Alcohol for the spirit. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, it's alcohol for the spirit. I'm drunk on privilege!

#### DAVID

Which is weird because spirits are alcohol for the body.

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Interesting! So if privilege--

#### DAVID

Is that anything?

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Privilege is alcohol for the spirit and spirits are alcohol for the body.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

But spirits are alcohol for the body.

#### TREXEL

And bodies are alcohol for the ground because when your body rots it becomes fertiliser!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

The system works!

#### DAVID

Okay. Wait, and the ground? That means the ground is alcohol for privilege!

#### TREXEL

How does that one work?

#### DAVID

Well, look. Let's workshop it.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

So--

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You don't have to workshop this.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, okay. Privilege is thinking that you own everything and the most fundamental thing that you can own is space. There's limited space; people can own it. That before any-- you know, before material wealth, before anything else, you say, "This plot of ground? That's mine. Give me five credits for standing on it."

#### DAVID

Exactly. And Doug Whimperton needs to stake their claim to their Whimperton ground, which is the Marketing department. And that means that they need to feed Bloug to the ground as alcohol...

#### TREXEL

In order to gain the privilege to own [__DAVID:__ Yes!] the ground that is rightfully theirs!

#### DAVID

So get the ground drunk on Bloug's corpse and that means that that's okay. Lovely!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Protofeudalism established. Serf's up!

#### TREXEL

Okay, well if you can-- if you can write that down into some sort of legal communiqué and, and submit it over there, maybe Doug will be able to, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] to commit this, this murder that you're really riding for.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Okay. Um, so, uh, it's just-- I'm so-- "Dear Doug, um, can I call you Doug? Whimperton! B-but not the, not the other one."

#### TREXEL

David, David--

#### DAVID

"I'm gonna assume you're--"

#### TREXEL

No, Da-- No, Da--

#### DAVID

No, hang o-- Aah! "I'm gonna--"

#### TREXEL

David, David, you're writing it like prose.

#### DAVID

"I'm gonna assume--" aah! "--that this is-- If this is Bloug, and I'm assuming your name is Bloug, then please hand this to Doug and don't read anything else, please."

#### TREXEL

Ooh, smart!

#### DAVID

Yeah, exactly.

#### TREXEL

I'd put it down.

#### DAVID

Hm. Full stop. Thank you. Right, so, um--

#### TREXEL

Maybe put a fold in so they have to unfold it.

#### DAVID

Ooh! Yes. Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Otherwise the eye could skim.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

I've seen a lot of incriminating documents because of a skimming eye! Whoops.

#### DAVID

##### [crinkle of paper being folded]

"More information below the fold."

#### TREXEL

Fold.

#### DAVID

##### [paper folding continues]

There we go! And just crease the line. Lovely!

#### TREXEL

Ooh, nice. Nice crease.

#### DAVID

Uh, so. "Hey, hey Doug, um, now Bloug's gone--"

#### TREXEL

Are you changing your handwriting so it's sort of more conspiratorial?

#### DAVID

Ooh, yes.

#### TREXEL

Like into italics.

#### DAVID

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

#### TREXEL

Like-- like, "Hello Bloug." "*Hey Doug.*"

#### DAVID

Okay, so I'll just-- I'll just-- I'll just sort of lean over a bit--

#### TREXEL

Lean over. Yep, yep.

#### DAVID

##### [writing this down, conspiratorial whisper]

##### [stutters]

Yep, okay. "Hey-- hey Doug. Uh, now Bloug's gone, just kill him. Just, just kill him."

#### TREXEL

Just kill him.

#### DAVID

"Just put him in an airlock. Maybe put them in a, a fire office." Uh...

#### TREXEL

And then, and then draw that little circle with, like, the ground, alcohol, the spirit-- that, yeah--

#### DAVID

Oh yes! Okay, okay. So we go-- Oh yeah, so--

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

To really sell it.

#### DAVID

"To explain, this is it." So we've got privilege--

#### TREXEL

"See circle of death."

#### DAVID

##### [saying what is being written]

Yeah, and then-- and so privilege and then that's the spirit and the spirit is the body and the body is the ground. The ground is the spirit!

#### TREXEL

Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. This is-- this is good! This is good.

#### DAVID

Ipso facto. We rest our cases. Love, the Expeditors. Good bye!"

#### TREXEL

"Objection. Overruled. Sustained."

#### DAVID

Um. "Objection. Overruled. Sustained."

#### TREXEL

Yes.

##### [walls begin to groan as they compact]

#### DAVID

Case rests. Uh, Trexel presiding.

#### TREXEL

Oh-- ah-- oh, uh, the walls, David! The walls! The walls!

#### DAVID

##### [nonsense noises]

Oh oh oh woah woah woah-ah. Uh, uh, uh, fold. Um, nope. That fold's wrong. Oh wait, no, unfold. I don't know. I just-- Gotta get this right!

#### TREXEL

It's not origami, David! Just put it in the tube!

#### DAVID

I made a tiny swan!

#### IMOGEN

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

##### [alarm beep, walls retract]

#### TREXEL

Aah!

#### DAVID

Ah!

#### TREXEL

There you go.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

The walls are receding. How do they keep so many guns in those walls?

#### TREXEL

I mean, it's a complicated looking wall, David, but we are not to reason why. Ours is just the job to die.

#### DAVID

Wha--

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs deeply]

#### DAVID

Hmm. Anyway--

#### TREXEL

I'm not enjoying this, David.

#### DAVID

Oka-- I mean--

#### TREXEL

This isn't my beat, you know?

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

##### [scoffs]

##### [scoffs]

##### [stammers]

You know, I don't feel at home. I don't feel like I contribute as much. I mean, you seem to be kind of taking to it in, in, in ways that are a little bit upsetting but I suppose at least somebody's doing the work and I don't have to do it but I felt when we were doing planetary design at least I could, I could contribute in many ways. And when we were doing sales, I mean, who's better at sales than me? No one, that's who, case dismissed. But here, I don't really know. I-- I don't--

#### DAVID

Well, Trexel, um, I have to say my secret has been learning anything at all. So if you can learn anything at all, maybe you'll become better at this job.

#### TREXEL

I mean, it's a thought.

#### DAVID

So why don't you go away and learn where the Astral Bar is.

#### TREXEL

...Okay, I'll-- I'll give it a go!

#### DAVID

Too-da-loo!

#### TREXEL

Too-da-loo.

#### DAVID

I'm gonna do some more body benchy upsy downsies.

#### TREXEL

No, David, I don't want you to be swole.

#### DAVID

I might do some, some "sit on the floor, then lie down, then sit down, then lie down, then sit on the floor"'s.

#### TREXEL

Well... as long as you don't neglect leg day.

#### DAVID

Okay, uh, oh--

#### TREXEL

I don't want you becoming a weird triangle.

#### DAVID

I'll-- I'll do some "I start standing and then I try and make my bum touch the floor. And then I stand up again! And then my bum goes on the floor! And then I stand up again! And then my bum towards the floor. And then I stand up again. And then a bum touch the floor."

__TREXEL: [interrupting]__ Okay. No, I-- I understand. David, I-- Goodbye, David!

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

##### [audio fades out]

Goodbye! And then my bum touch the floor, and I stand up again. And then I wave my arms around! No, it doesn't work. And my bum touch the floor--
