##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [noises of tinkering and writing]

#### DAVID

##### [whispering to himself]

Okay, just get this, this screwed on and here. Okay. And, just get a pencil and... Okay.

##### [footsteps approach, door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

##### [David exclaims in surprise]

David.  What are you doing?

#### DAVID

Uh, nothing.

#### TREXEL

You're hunched over in the corner, David. [__DAVID:__ No.] What are you doing in the corner all hunched?

#### DAVID

Uh, pooping.

#### TREXEL

I-- I don't think-- David, you're still in your onesie. Th--

#### DAVID

Pooping-- Um, not-- um, I'm definitely-- N-nothing. I'm, I'm pooping nothing.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

That is just called sitting.

#### TREXEL

David, I'm--

#### DAVID

I'm practicing. Practicing to poop.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

David, please. David. I am the most experienced liar you've ever met. Do you know how you can tell? 'Cause that might have been a lie and  *you'd never know*! I'm just that good. So, I know a lie when I hear one, and that right there is a lie. I can see you and you are not pooping!

#### DAVID

Um... I was practicing to poop.

#### TREXEL

You were practicing, were you?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, you know, that's fair enough. Keep in practice, I suppose. You don't wanna get it wrong. What if you suddenly need one and you've forgotten how? [__DAVID:__ I know.] "Oh, I've fallen sideways. It's all wrong!"

#### DAVID

##### [puts something on desk]

Exactly. Um, so I'm just gonna... shuffle over with my back towards you [__TREXEL:__ Shuffling--] and then we're just gonna...  pop this down here and then okay, no. Here we go. Hello.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammering]

No, but what was that? You just popped something on the desk there, David.

#### DAVID

Po-- poop. It was a practice poop. I have a small... model of a--

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Warning: stop talking about faeces.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay. David, you know what I've decided? I don't care.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Whatever you're hiding, whatever you're doing, whatever practice you're having--

#### DAVID

Poop.

#### TREXEL

--it's not my business. So let's just push on, shall we?

#### DAVID

Yes. Okay. Right, shall I-- I'll get the brief out then.

#### TREXEL

Please.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, today we are seeing Agent 4206--

#### TREXEL

Have you been doing it *all* weekend?

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Have you been crouching in the corner doing something *all* weekend?

#### DAVID

##### [neutral]

No.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, it's not important. It's not impor-- I don't care. The important thing is I don't care.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But if you were to tell me, I would be-- I don't care. I don't care. Sorry. Go on. Go on.

#### DAVID

So, the brief. Today. Now.

#### TREXEL

The-- today. Yeah, fine.

#### DAVID

##### [chuckles]

It's from Agent 42069-- nice!--of the [REDACTED] Agency. Their preferred pronouns are they or them. Um, and they want a planet built to train the new recruits in essential spying skills such as interrogation, stealth, and train-station-spotting.

#### TREXEL

Interesting. Interesting.

#### DAVID

Uh, their likes and dislikes. Well, they like cute cat videos and murder.

#### TREXEL

Who doesn't?

#### DAVID

And they dislike humour and inefficiency.

#### TREXEL

Do hoesn't? [*sic*]

#### DAVID

If they were an animal, what would they be? Uh, that is... classified, apparently.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Um, but their very greatest strength is that they are a very good listener, I suppose with all the spying and hiding in bushes with sort of dishes with rods on them. Um, and what is their greatest weakness? It is "they are bad at understanding maths-based puns".

#### TREXEL

Well, you know what they say. Divide and conquer.

#### DAVID

Oh, very good. Yes. Very well--

#### TREXEL

Very good what?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Um... Uh...  Never mind. Um, so, this is who we are meeting. It's Agent 42069.

__DAVID, TREXEL, and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Nice.

#### TREXEL

This is, this is tricky, David, because, um... the [REDACTED] Agency, we don't know what they're called because it's redacted. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] That's kind of the point. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] But the thing is, it's the only thing that tends to be redacted, so if you call something the [REDACTED] Agency to hide its name--

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Everyone knows which agency you're talking about  because they're the [REDACTED] Agency.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Because it's the [REDACTED] Agency. There's not another one.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

It's a very bad system! But they're very dangerous people, David. These are not--  It's not an organ of Stellar Firma but it's more sort of a trusted partner.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Stellar Firma will use them to, you know, spy out dissidence or root out plots of some kind. Not that there has ever been a plot because why would anybody want to, to plot against and overthrow Stellar Firma Ltd.? It's a wonderful company and I love it very dearly.

#### DAVID

No. Nobody would *ever* want to do that.

#### TREXEL

But if they did, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] it might be the agents of the [REDACTED] Agency that mercilessly murder them in a bin.

#### DAVID

That explains why all the guns that come out of the walls have "[REDACTED]" written on them.

#### TREXEL

That's why.

#### DAVID

Ahh. It's all coming together.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

I wanted them to say "IMOGEN".

#### TREXEL

So, this is-- it's not, it's not an internal job. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] The-- they are an external agency but they're a very trusted partner. You get this wrong, you're gonna annoy people up to the very tippy-top.

#### DAVID

Yes. Now, I know this might... this might annoy you.

#### TREXEL

##### [gets louder]

Most things do, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] In fact, the fact that you even pointed that out  *has made me quite irritated but go on!*

#### DAVID

Would we need to, perchance, offer them some sort of... discount?

#### TREXEL

##### [quiet anger]

What did you say?

#### DAVID

I, I said a discount.

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN, deploy the guns.

#### DAVID

##### [terrified yelling]

No! What?

#### IMOGEN

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

Alert. Manual deployment of gun wall.

#### DAVID

I didn't know you could do that!

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

Yes, in a very special circumstance, I can.  A discount?!

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

I can't believe what I'm hearing!

#### DAVID

You didn't.

#### TREXEL

Is there blood coming out of my ears, David?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

*Well then, that should prove to you how seriously I'm taking this!*

#### DAVID

Wait, that was a lie. There aren't.

#### TREXEL

##### [slightly calmer]

There aren't any discounts?

#### DAVID

There aren't-- there's no blood or discount. There are no discounts... for anyone. Ever.

#### TREXEL

Under any circumstances?

#### DAVID

##### [beeping becomes higher and more frequent]

Wait,  including the Board asking for a planet?

#### TREXEL

Why would you complicate this for yourself, David?

#### DAVID

I don't know.

#### TREXEL

There was a simple answer to that and now the answer is unclear!

#### DAVID

But I had to think about it--

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

*Tread carefully, 7!*

#### DAVID

##### [under stress]

Um... uh... the correct answer is usually no unless... said by a person who it should be applied to!

#### TREXEL

Incomprehensible garbage that sounds like business, that is the correct answer. IMOGEN, I think we're okay.

##### [low tone beeping stops]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [gun disassembles and retracts; David takes deep breaths]

Manual deployment ended.  You only get to do that once a quarter.

#### TREXEL

##### [deep breath]

##### [David whimpers]

So, now we've navigated *that hot mess*, [__DAVID:__  Yeah.] what I was going to say, David, [__DAVID:__ Yes. Yes.] is that it is key that we don't ruffle the wrong sort of feathers. Because, if you ruffle the wrong feather, turns out that bird was a secret bomb. Kaboom! You've died!  And now your coffin's covered in feathers. So, we need to approach this very, very carefully. We don't know anything about the [REDACTED] Agency, about its organization, about its agents, let alone this particular agent. Why did they come to us? Why do they want it now? Where do they live? Do they like ham? It's unclear.

#### DAVID

Well, ham's not answered, but they do want it so they can train new recruits in essential spy skills such as interrogation, stealth, and train-station-spotting.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so it's, it's a corporate job. It's a corporate job. So, maybe the fact that we don't know too much personally about this agent doesn't matter all that much because, let's just say you're, let's just say you're a bureaucrat in a municipal council of some sort and you want a small regional library built. It's not about you. It's about books and, I don't know, children or something. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] So, it doesn't matter really about the agent.

#### DAVID

So, this is more about, you know, uh, fleeting looks and suitcases left on park benches than an actual agent.

#### TREXEL

It's about a pair of sunglasses with a mirror carefully hidden in one side so you can look behind yourself.

#### DAVID

It's about an umbrella that looks like an umbrella but then, ooh! What is this? A little trigger. It's a gun now.

#### TREXEL

It's about a pen that explodes when you whisper.

#### DAVID

Ooh. It's about a car that's actually a bird.

#### TREXEL

It's about a bird that's actually a boat.

#### DAVID

It's about a boat that's actually a pen.

#### TREXEL

It's about a pen that writes on paper.

#### DAVID

Precisely. Devious.

#### TREXEL

Devious indeed. So, we want a, a secret agent training school [__DAVID:__ Yes.] for the secret agent trainers.

#### DAVID

Yes, for Agent 4206 and then the number 9.

#### TREXEL

But the question is David, how do we apply the Trexel Geistman Ten Steps To Sales Domination plan!

##### [cheerful jingle]

#### DAVID

I... don't know.

#### TREXEL

Lesson 7--

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

--curiosity. *It may have killed the cat*, but maybe that cat deserved everything it had coming to it.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Extrajudicial animal murder detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Maybe the cat was a spy.

#### TREXEL

Could have been a spy. You need to be curious as a salesperson. What's in there? Who's that? Where am I? Is this mine? I've drunk it already, so it hardly matters at this stage.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So, how do you apply curiosity to sales, David? How do you-- You know what? Let's turn this to you.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

How do you think being a curious little clone allows you to be a better salesperson?

#### DAVID

Well--

#### TREXEL

This is an interactive learning experience now because I'm a bit tired.

#### DAVID

##### [tone switches to logical, calculating, and without feeling]

Okay. Well, asking questions of the client allows you to understand them better. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] And if you understand them better, if we...  apply the other... lessons, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] you know their weaknesses. What makes them tick. What you can use against them.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes.

#### TREXEL

David.

#### DAVID

##### [normal]

Or because you take a real interest in their lives and want to fill their needs.

#### TREXEL

##### [David chuckles nervously]

Don't-- don't think I didn't see that sweet, secret vein of sociopathy that you're trying to cover up with those, with those little paper hands of yours.  You're getting it, David.

#### DAVID

##### [anxious]

Yes, I'm--

#### TREXEL

You're getting it.

#### DAVID

--learning from a good teacher.

#### TREXEL

You need to be curious in order to find people's faults.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

But curiosity isn't enough! [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Curiosity implies people are volunteering information or you're merely paying attention to the things people say and do.  *That's not the Geistman way!*

#### DAVID

Well, what is the Geistman way then?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Why would you ask?

#### TREXEL

Spying. You spy on the spy. The "spyee" becomes the "spyer". The spymasters switch in a spy transfer. Spy versus spy versus spy!

#### DAVID

Okay. Wait, who's the third spy? Am I the third spy?!

#### TREXEL

Who can say?

#### DAVID

Am I spying on you?

#### TREXEL

Spy on spy.

#### DAVID

##### [yells]

*Where were you on Thursday?*

#### TREXEL

This is some spy on spy action. Where were you on Tuesday?

#### DAVID

I was in this office.

#### TREXEL

I wasn't anywhere. I was in the vacuum of space.

#### DAVID

No you weren't. You were in this office with me.

#### TREXEL

I was up there for a hot second.

#### DAVID

Well... I can't prove or disprove that. Damn it! He's got me!

#### TREXEL

I've got him!

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Because I'm a spy.

#### DAVID

Oh, fair enough.

#### TREXEL

We need to make you a spy.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, we need to spy on Agent 4 then the numbers 206 and then the number 9.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Nice.

#### DAVID

And we have to do that in the next ten minutes before we meet with them otherwise we can't gather any sweet, sweet intel about them. So, how are we gonna do that now?

#### TREXEL

Trench coats.

#### DAVID

But--

#### TREXEL

Massive trench coats.

#### DAVID

So-- Wait, so we're gonna, we're gonna get trench coats and, and go find them now in preparation for the meeting we're having soon?

#### TREXEL

No, David. No, that seems foolish. They're in a shuttle. We can't get in there. We spy on them mid-meeting.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

One giant trench coat. Two spies. I'll sit on your shoulders and whilst I'm distracting them as we sit down, you crawl out underneath the table, creep up behind them, take out their pocketbook from their back pocket, and start rifling through for secrets and details.

#### DAVID

So, what you're saying is that I, David 7, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] a clerical clone, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] am going to have to engage in espionage against a trained spy who works for *the thing that controls the guns in the walls!*

#### TREXEL

I don't see the problem, David.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You have never seen the problem. That* is* the problem.

#### TREXEL

Are you a coward?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Oh. Well, in which case, let's toughen you up.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Scenario one.

#### DAVID

Uh, okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

You're behind enemy lines. You've had *all* of your legs chopped off.

#### DAVID

All of them?!

#### TREXEL

All of them!

#### DAVID

Oh, no!

#### TREXEL

You don't know where you are. You keep on smelling lavender and don't know where it's coming from, [__DAVID:__ Eugh.] but you are in the basement of a stalag. I don't know what one of them is, but it's in a lot of old films that I keep ignoring the ends of!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

How do you climb up and get to the intel? Go!

#### DAVID

Who is, who is the enemy?

#### TREXEL

No, it's impossible to tell until you get the intel.

#### DAVID

Oh, no! Um, uh, uh. What shape is the stalag basement?

#### TREXEL

It's a rhomboid.

#### DAVID

Okay, then, in which case I get-- Do I have a chair?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Okay. Do I have another chair?

#### TREXEL

No.

#### DAVID

Wha-- Okay. I use the one chair; I break it into two chairs. I hold onto each of those chairs and put them on my feet like big stilts. And then I walk around going, "Oh, I'm a big person."

#### TREXEL

Like a spy pirate.

#### DAVID

Yes, like a spy pirate. And I'm like, "Ooh, I'm a very big person and the person that you arrested is very little."

#### TREXEL

There's a rattling at the door. One of the guards is coming down the stone stairway, its MP 40 in its hand.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, I am still the big person. I'm so big that I couldn't possibly be the prisoner that I am.

#### TREXEL

"Well, this all seems regular. I'm just gonna walk into this corner and stand still."

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You've passed him, David.

#### DAVID

Good job.

#### TREXEL

Up the stairs.

#### DAVID

Here I go. Clomp clomp clomp clomp clomp clomp clomp.

#### TREXEL

You've reached what appears to be an office. There are big red banners everywhere and lots of people doing... admin.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um, how many of the people are looking at me?

#### TREXEL

None. They're all looking at their desks *because they're drones*,* David*.

#### DAVID

Good. I karate chop one of them in the spine.

#### TREXEL

They make a loud wailing noise. Everyone turns 'round and picks up a ruler.

#### DAVID

Oh, that was unexpected. I pick up two pens which are more powerful than rulers as well we know.

#### TREXEL

They scatter.

#### DAVID

Right. Good. I riffle through their briefcases for intel.

#### TREXEL

You've found incriminating pictures of them walking a lovely little dog, which is in stark contrast to their tough guy image. They are shamed.

#### DAVID

Exactly. They're all a bunch of lovely people. And I will tell the galaxy! And I run at them with-- No, no. Hang on a minute. I don't run. I eat the papers because my--

#### TREXEL

You eat the papers?

#### DAVID

Well, my clone digestion doesn't quite degrade paper. So, I'll just poop them out in very nicely tied up rolls.

#### TREXEL

David, David, David.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

You've overcomplicated this. It was very straightforward up until now. And all of a sudden, you're eating the paper and hoping your digestive acids will only damage it a little bit. These are photos. They're very, very sensitive chemical things on there.

#### DAVID

Oh no, I know this. [__TREXEL:__ What?] For a fact. Empirically.

#### TREXEL

You've eaten documents before?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

What documents have you eaten, David? And more importantly, why?

#### DAVID

Test briefs and because I was bored!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Xylophagia detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

I suppose you do spend an *absolutely enormous* amount of time, outside of our meetings, just in here. On your own.

#### DAVID

I have picked up a lot of hobbies.

#### TREXEL

Well, we all know there's one hobby you picked up that we *don't* talk about anymore. I hope you haven't been engaging in it again. What-- What other hobbies have you got, David?

#### DAVID

Um, figurine... creation?

#### TREXEL

Really?

#### DAVID

Sleeping horizontally.

#### TREXEL

Well, that's a good one, I like that.

#### DAVID

Going to the toilet on a toilet!

#### TREXEL

It's very bourgeois, David, but it is your right. Okay! Fine. So, you've done pretty well as a spy, David. Not perfectly, not top marks but for a first go, not bad. You know what happened on my first go?

#### DAVID

Uh, it all went really well.

#### TREXEL

##### [awkward laugh]

No, murder party. [__DAVID:__ Oh!] I had a party based entirely on murder. It turned out that the simulation that I was in-- It was an early one, so it actually was just actors. I didn't realize this until, [__DAVID:__ Oh, no.]  until my hands seized up because of all the coagulated blood.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

What is the point of covering things up if you then just tell people?

#### DAVID [nervously]

Great!

#### TREXEL

So! You did better than me, in that particular instance.

#### DAVID

Oh, yep.

#### TREXEL

So, I think you've got what it takes, David. You've got what it takes to have me sit on your shoulders.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Sit down, with me still on your shoulders [__DAVID:__ ...Yes.] but meaning that our-- our rear end will be the joint between your shoulders and my legs [__DAVID:__ Well--] so it looks like we're sitting down properly.

#### DAVID

Well, if-- if you have your legs, sort of just, just hanging down and then when I sit on the chair--

#### TREXEL

You just sort of slither down?

#### DAVID

I sag until you're standing on the chair and that's your-- our torso height.

#### TREXEL

It'll look like we've literally folded in half like a piece of paper but I don't think they know what humans are all that well. Nobody does.

#### DAVID

You know, everyone's got different biologies and also I'm a clone, not a human, so....

#### TREXEL

Yes, but you know what, I'm human and I'll be on top--

#### DAVID

*Are* you human?

#### TREXEL [scoffs]

##### [loses confidence and sense of self]

##### [stammers]

Yes, I'm a...  I'm pretty sure I'm a human I've always been... I don't actually think I've ever been directly told I'm a human. Oh Board, David, am I a human? If I'm not a human what am I? Some sort of sea slug? Some sort of... sautÃ©ed sea slug? Drinking a glass of whiskey at the corner [__DAVID:__ Wait, no!] of a bar?

#### DAVID

Trexel, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Barkeep, give me a soul!

#### DAVID

Trexel, Trexel, no! Check your passbook!

#### TREXEL

##### [grunts as he checks it]

Well.

#### DAVID

What does it say? Under species.

#### TREXEL

##### [extremely relieved]

"T. Geistman: Human Restricted Travel."  Oh, gosh! Oh!

#### DAVID

There you go.

#### TREXEL

Oh, that was a close one, David. I was pretty close to imagining I was actually just a concept there.

#### DAVID

##### [slight rustle of paper]

Yeah, personally I just have this  A5 piece paper that just says "clone" on it.

#### TREXEL

It just has clone. Nothing else written on it. Just the word "clone"!

#### DAVID

Nothing. Nothing else. Just the word "clone". Yep.

#### TREXEL

But, you know...

#### DAVID [resigned sigh]

So it goes.

#### TREXEL

So it goes.

#### DAVID

So it goes.

#### TREXEL

So! We've got a plan. We're going to spy on the spy whilst the spy is [__DAVID:__ Is...] having a meeting with us.

#### DAVID

Yes. Okay. So we have sort of a, a general idea. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] But what am I actually looking for? What-- The [REDACTED] Agency, like, how do they operate? If they were coming to-- If-- If you were a member of the [REDACTED] Agency [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] and you were coming to a client-planet-creation meeting, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] how would you store all of your very secret documents?

#### TREXEL

Pocketbooks.

#### DAVID

Pocketbooks.

#### TREXEL

In this age of digital information, David, the safest place in the world is on a piece of paper. Who cares about paper? Do you know how much paper I've ignored? [__DAVID:__ Yes.] "Oh, oh, Mister Geistman, your test results are here. It's on this piece of paper." I've just thrown it away! "Oh, Mister Geistman, it's a letter from your long lost brother." I've just burned it, David, because paper is for fires.

#### DAVID

Wait, can-- Okay, no. Yep. Fair enough. Okay, paper is for fires.

#### TREXEL

Paper is for fires. That's why I've started so many fires.

#### DAVID

Okay, that all makes sense. So, we want to start a fire in this person's pockets.

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, David! Because then you ruin the information.

#### DAVID

Right! We're gonna steal the information--

#### TREXEL

That's a Geistman Thing. A David Thing will be reading the information, putting it into a digital format so it actually counts, and then passing it to me. So, you're looking for a little pocketbook, a little notepad, something that, if necessary, they could cut two eye holes out of and hide behind on a park bench.

#### DAVID

Okay, so I'll just-- I'll bring my portable IMOGEN. Just have--

#### TREXEL

Your what?

#### DAVID

Portable IMOGEN.

#### TREXEL

Your-- Your what?

#### DAVID

Portable IMOGEN!

#### TREXEL

You have a portable IMOGEN?

#### DAVID

Yeah, there's one in that slot over there.

#### TREXEL

What!

#### DAVID

Yeah, see--

#### TREXEL

I never knew what that slot was for!

#### DAVID

By the keyboard, look!

#### TREXEL

I've been putting packets of crisps in there!

#### IMOGEN [beeps]

#### DAVID

Oh, that's no good. No, there's a portable IMOGEN. Look, she's here on this little screen [__TREXEL:__ Wow.] and you can type things in and it gives you the IMOGEN information.

#### TREXEL

Wow, technology these days.

#### DAVID

I know, right? Just-- I could take it anywhere with me! If I went anywhere except for here and the client room.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

I'm also already everywhere anyway.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

##### [breaks down into laughter]

##### [pause]

Isn't it ironic that you're the one with the portable IMOGEN but you're trapped in here, and you can't leave. And I can go anywhere I want, within reason, and I just--  What a pair we make, David! What a pair we make.  Yeah.

#### DAVID [strained]

Yes. Yes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Read the room.

#### DAVID [gradually starts to break down] [awkward chuckle]

Anyway! So, I'll take my portable IMOGEN, and I'm gonna take it into the one other place that I can go, then I'm gonna go slightly further than that place, by sliding under the client's chair. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] And I'm gonna take some pocketbooks out of their pockets and I'm gonna tap, tap, tap, tap, tap [__TREXEL:__ Tap, tap.] the information into my remote IMOGEN which gives it some point.

#### TREXEL

Some point. Some tiny point.

#### DAVID [almost completely breaking down]

And then, everything will be fine!

#### TREXEL

Everything will be fine. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] But David, things might not be fine.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

You could get caught.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

What if they see you?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL [increasingly dramatically]

##### [back in his normal voice]

This is the agency we're talking about, the [REDACTED] Agency. [__DAVID:__ Gun wall!] They'll murder you on the spot, David! [__DAVID:__ No!] You thought recycling was bad, wait until you've been held down and a [REDACTED] agent looks in your eyes and closes their hands around your throat and squeezes and squeezes until the life is forced out of you!  And we don't want that to happen, David, because that'll be a real hassle for *me*. So, what we're going to do is we're going to distract them. What do they like? Remind me what they like and what they're weak against.

#### DAVID

##### [nervous sigh]

Um... Okay. Well, they, they like... cute cat videos and murder.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

##### [deep, panicked breath]

Um, they dislike humour and inefficiency. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Um, their greatest strength is they're a good--  they're a very good listener, which means they're gonna hear me under the chair rifling through their pockets--

#### TREXEL

David. David. David, calm down.

#### DAVID

##### [having a panic attack]

##### [incomprehensible panicked noises]

--getting their books, , tap tap tap tap tap. Tap tap tap tap tap.

#### TREXEL

David, calm.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Warning: clone spiraling.

#### DAVID

No tap tap tap tap tap.

#### TREXEL

David, calm down. David, you're starting, you're starting to hyperventilate.

#### DAVID

##### [becomes incomprehensible]

I'm gonna be--

#### TREXEL

Quickly! Breathe into this paper bag!

##### [David breathes into the bag]

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps; Trexel laughs]

No! No, give me that back! That's for fire!  Oh, I love a fire.

#### DAVID

##### [taking deep breaths]

Well-- Okay. Well, their greatest weakness... is understanding... maths-based puns.

#### TREXEL

##### [takes something out]

##### [bells on puppet jingle]

Okay, so, what we're gonna do, I don't have access to cat-based videos, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] but I do have  a hand puppet.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Puppet detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

##### [bells jingle]

Now, this isn't of a cat, but I think it looks close enough to a cat, so I'm going to do a little cat dance  with my hand puppet on the desk.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [bells jingle throughout] [sings]

And you're creeping underneath. And I'm going, â™ª "meow meow meow, I'm a little kitty cat, and I'm doing something I shouldn't do. Is that milk mine? No, that milk's not mine, but I'm gonna lap it up all the same. Oh, I've been caught! My hackles are raised. I've tried to run away. No, I'm sliding on a floor! This floor is so slick, and I've hit a wall. Yes, I've hit it." â™« And then I murder the puppet.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Because that's what they like, cat videos and murder.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And then the puns begin.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I don't want to take up a *fraction* of your time.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes. No, I see.

#### TREXEL

Oh sorry, did you understand that? I think you're a bit... non*plus*sed.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, like-- Yeah. No, yeah.

#### TREXEL

Ah, do you want it to be cold in here? Because I like my temperature to be at *minus* four.

#### DAVID

Oh, fundamentally the same joke but in reverse. Yep, no, I see it.

#### TREXEL

Oh no! It seems that you've become a *quadratic equation* of some kind. Perhaps I can put you in some *brackets*.

##### [pause]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Swing and a miss.

#### DAVID

I don't--

#### TREXEL

*Decimal point*!

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

No, that didn't--

#### TREXEL

*Vertices*!

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

*Angle* of attack!

#### DAVID

Tha-- Well, that's not--

#### TREXEL

*Graph*!

#### DAVID

Pardon?

#### TREXEL

##### [sobs]

Graph!

#### DAVID

Graph.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

##### [starts sobbing]

*Percy!*

#### DAVID

Ooh! Uh...

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

*Where are you, Percy!*

##### [loud knocks begin]

#### DAVID

Well, what is that?

#### TREXEL

Oh, we've run out of time.

#### DAVID

Trexel, come back to me.

#### TREXEL

##### [takes a deep breath]

Okay.

#### DAVID

Right, so we should--

#### TREXEL

It's reminded me, David.

#### DAVID

--we should go. We've got a plan.

#### TREXEL

I got all over excited about spying.

#### DAVID

Have you got your big trench coat?

#### TREXEL

##### [pulls out trench coat]

Yes, I've got--

#### DAVID

No, okay. So, you seriously-- you just have a big trench coat?

#### TREXEL

I've just got a big trench coat.

#### DAVID

We didn't order-- We just-- You just have--

#### TREXEL

What kind of consultant would I be if I didn't have a giant trench coat that's long enough for two people to be on top of each other? How do you think I sneak into places with Harry?

#### DAVID

Yep, I don't know how to answer that question.

#### TREXEL

Right, so just get underneath me.

##### [both struggle to get one on top of the other]

#### TREXEL

##### [wobbling]

Oh, it's difficult to stay on your shoulders.

#### DAVID

You are very weirdly buoyant.

#### TREXEL

##### [David chokes a little]

Well, you're really weirdly slimy. What's your point? Oh, and David, I know that--woah!--

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [continued struggle to stay upright]

I may have got very over excited about how fun it is to spy on things, but I don't want you to forget that I'm still very angry at you--

#### DAVID

Oh! Here we go!

#### TREXEL

--for everything you did last week.

#### DAVID

In through the door!

##### [door opens]

#### TREXEL

##### [from the meeting room]

Oh. Oh! Ah, Agent 42069.

#### DAVID

##### [from the meeting room]

Nice!

#### TREXEL

Do you like how we walk? 'Cause *algorithm's* gonna getcha!

#### DAVID

Waahhaaa! Woo!
