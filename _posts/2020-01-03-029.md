#### ALEX

I'd just like to take a moment to thank some of our patrons: Spooooky, Kate Talbot, Lisa K., Jari Thorup Palo, Lou Harrison, Elliot, Claudia Howard, Amanda Lord, Sarah Cavanagh, Jessica Freeman, Freshcat, dog, Elizabeth Kalbacher, Aine Morgan, Corvin J Lyn, Kit, Cody Wolfe, Iris Lazuli, Sparr, Carrie LeClair. Thank you all. We really appreciate your support. If you'd like to join them, go to www.patreon.com/rustyquill and take a look at our rewards.

#### TREXEL

##### [sort of chuckles]

Special thanks to Molly & Emily. May you never be involved in a case of  *hil*-arious mistaken identity.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [soothing music playing in background]

#### DAVID

So, what you're saying then is that I need to be more... demanding?

#### IMOGEN

*Assertive*. Employee personality assessment, and post-incident mortality investigations, suggest that assertive communication between colleagues is key to effective working relationships and non-hostile work environments.

#### DAVID

Right... so... h-how will I know if I'm being assertive?

##### [soothing music dies down]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Quiz time!

##### [upbeat, chiptune quiz music plays]

#### IMOGEN

A colleague has misplaced their pen for the third day in a row. They ask to borrow yours, but have repeatedly lost yours in the past. Do you: A) give them your pen and use your own vital life fluid oozing from a wound in your hand to make notes instead. B) Calmly request they requisition a new pen from supplies in full knowledge of the terrible price this will cost them and their loved ones. C) Attack them violently as a drain on company time and resources, using your pen as a weapon!

##### [quiz music grows more frantic and distorted]

#### DAVID

Um... oh, gosh, wha... uh, I suppose I don't want to *attack* them, and--

#### IMOGEN

Answer!

#### DAVID

--and their loved ones did nothing wrong...

#### IMOGEN

Answer!

#### DAVID [growing anxious]

But it *is* my pen... and *I* didn't do anything wrong...

#### IMOGEN [distorted]

__*Answer!*__

#### DAVID [panicking]

##### [breathing fast]

Ehh... A! A. I will go with A, they can have my pen, just make it stop.

##### [pause, then beep]

#### IMOGEN

Assessing response. Vocal tone... heart rate... sweat pH...

#### DAVID

...Wait, h-how do you know my sweat--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Ding! Personality assessment: passive to passive aggressive. Some tendency towards explosive outbursts caused by intense emotional stress.

#### DAVID

##### [scoffs]

So... so, what should *I* do about it?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Spend more time outside.

#### DAVID

Oh, for *Board's sake*--

##### [door hisses open]

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID [sputtering]

Wh...

#### TREXEL

Daviiiid.

#### DAVID [upset David noises]

#### TREXEL

Aw, look at you there. Oh, you're like-- you're almost like a real person, relaxing in your little pod there! Working at your little desk, it's nice! It's nice to see, David, I'm glad.

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ Oh, it's lovely to have a pod. [__TREXEL:__ Isn't it though?] *Finally*.

#### TREXEL [self-satisfied]

You're welcome.

#### DAVID

*Mmmm...*

#### TREXEL

You are welcome.

#### DAVID

Well...

#### TREXEL

How are you enjoying your pod, David?

#### DAVID

It's very nice. I actually get to lie horizontally.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, that's pleasant!

#### DAVID

There is a pillow! [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] And an... duvet.

#### TREXEL

But do you-- do you *miss* the chair?

#### DAVID [immediately]

Nope.

#### TREXEL

Just sitting up in the chair--

#### DAVID

Nope.

#### TREXEL

--waiting for me--

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

--hour after hour?

#### DAVID

##### [turns on lamp]

I have a little lamp, [__TREXEL:__ Often in the dark!] so I can see... yes, I have a little lamp, I can turn it on.

#### TREXEL

Nice.

#### DAVID

Lights up my desk.

#### TREXEL

Very nice.

#### DAVID

The little IMOGEN terminal, so I can just...

#### TREXEL

You what now?

#### DAVID

Mm?

#### TREXEL

What did we discuss, David.

#### DAVID

Oh, no, I c--

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

##### [quieter]

You need to be *careful* on IMOGEN. [__DAVID:__ So that I can--] If people find out that you've still got-- If people find out that you've still got access...

#### DAVID

Ssso that I can... browse...

#### TREXEL

Mmm?

#### DAVID

...*authorized and sanctioned...* parts of IMOGEN's database... in order... to *supplement...* my work.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Clearing terminal cache. Erasing browsing history. Eating cookies.

#### TREXEL

It's dodgy ground, David. The fact that you've got an IMOGEN terminal at all as a clone is a little bit here-and-there...

#### DAVID [incredulously]

It's built into the desk!

#### TREXEL

Yes, but it's for *me!* It's not *for* you!

#### DAVID

But that's *my* desk!

#### TREXEL

It's-- oh, *I'm* sorry--

#### DAVID

It's in *my* pod!

#### TREXEL

Oh, is it? Oh, this is *your* desk in *your* pod. These are all Stellar Firma desks and pods, David! You are just *allowed* to sleep in one.

#### DAVID

Well, in a Stellar Firma-sanctioned desk that is sanctioned for clones, like me, there is an IMOGEN terminal!

#### TREXEL

All right, David! Maybe it's the case-- [__DAVID:__ Look, it's small, it's got--] but I've never been entirely clear on what the rights of clones are! Yes, that's possible! But--

#### DAVID

Look, it's small, it's got big buttons made of red plastic. But it's still my terminal!

#### TREXEL

It's Clone's First Terminal, yes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

They grow up so fast...

#### TREXEL

But, you're enjoying your new pod.

#### DAVID

Yes! I am. I... enjoy feeling like a person!

#### TREXEL

Oh, I see you've-- you've drawn little pictures. And-- and sort of stuck them on--

#### DAVID

No. You can-- No.

#### TREXEL

##### [tears paper off]

Let's have a--  let's see that there...

#### DAVID

##### [flustered spluttering]

No-- Give that back!

#### TREXEL

##### [paper rustles]

What's th-- who's this?  David, is this a... have you drawn a picture of Bathin?

#### DAVID [most convincing "no" voice]

No.

#### TREXEL

Well, it says "Bathin", and you've put a heart on top of the "I" instead of a dot.

#### DAVID

*I have not.*

#### TREXEL

##### [scoffs]

Well, I mean...  you've drawn him with such rippling abs, David.

#### DAVID [defensively]

Well... from what we--

#### TREXEL

##### [paper rustles]

Any pictures of me in here? Any *fond pictures* of Trexel Geistman, your-- your savior? Your trial savior?

#### DAVID [

##### [pause]

__crosstalk____]__ *Oh*, no. Because you obviously transcend the... visual image.  And cannot be captured.

#### TREXEL

##### [David grunts]

##### [hands over paper]

Thank you, David. That's very kind. That's very kind, but I'd like you to draw a picture of me.  Right now.

#### DAVID

Right--

#### TREXEL

Draw a picture of me, David.

#### DAVID

*Right* now?

#### TREXEL

Right now.

#### DAVID

O... o-okay?

#### TREXEL

I'm going to wait.

#### DAVID

Could you give me my pens back, please?

#### TREXEL

##### [hands over pen]

Mmm, here you go.

#### DAVID

All right. Just a-- just a min--

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

Now hang on a-- I'm gonna strike a pose.  *Ahh.*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Yikes!

#### TREXEL

Triumphant. [__DAVID:__ Eugh.] Powerful.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, here we go, um...

#### TREXEL

Knowledgeable, certainly.

#### DAVID

##### [begins drawing]

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Beyond reproach.

#### DAVID

Uhhh...

#### TREXEL

Feared by his enemies. __[____crosstalk____]__ Loved by his friends.

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ And how long do you want me to... spend on this?

#### TREXEL

As long as it takes to capture...* all this.*

#### DAVID [vaguely disgusted]

*All* of it?

#### TREXEL

All of this.

#### DAVID

Just really...

#### TREXEL

Mighty!

#### DAVID

Getting it all...

#### TREXEL

Thrusting! Dignified!

#### DAVID

C-can you stop thrusting, please?

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Okay, what have you got?

#### DAVID [muttering]

##### [hands over paper]

Carry the two and, uh, there we go. There... there you go.

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

##### [crumples up paper]

...I'm just-- I'm just gonna get rid of that.

#### DAVID

Wha--?? But--

#### TREXEL

Let's move on, David.

#### DAVID

That's...

#### TREXEL

Let's just, uh-- that hurts.

#### DAVID

*What?*

#### TREXEL

Don't just-- oh, I mean [__DAVID:__ I--] that's very insulting.

#### DAVID

I-- I just drew you!

#### TREXEL [pause]

Oh, I see.

#### DAVID

What? I--

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ And that's what you see, is it?

#### DAVID

I-- I told you that your countenance was uncapturable. Like trying to pin lightning to a paper. So, if I failed, that's my artistry failing... you. Right? Agreed?

#### TREXEL

I can accept that! This is your failure, not mine.

#### DAVID

Yep, that... is-- yep, that's how it works.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful stuff. Okay, well how about we get on with the brief then, David?

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

Oh, wha-- *really?* __[____crosstalk____]__ We can get on with the brief?

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ Yeah, let's just, let's just push on and get on with the brief, [__DAVID:__ Oh?] 'cause I feel like you're wasting time.

#### DAVID

Oh, you're so focused. Okay, right--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### TREXEL [muttering under breath, imitating David]

Eh, I'm David 7.

#### DAVID

##### [pause]

--and, uh... woah, this is one. Right. Uh, strap in.  "I... am Fugatissiman."

#### TREXEL

Okay?

#### DAVID

"A proud Murk-Phonitographer of Marpark-Onkh."

#### TREXEL [sighs]

Okay?

#### DAVID

"And *I*... am Archexianniam, a wandering extradimensional being lost in the confines of your miserable four-dimensional space."

#### TREXEL

Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just a-- just a minute. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm?] Is this... two people with-- with different personalities, or is this one with-- with two aspects? There's dimensional stuff in there, they're extradimensional, but also they're a... Murk-Phonographer, whatever that is?

#### DAVID

Murk-Phonitographer.

#### TREXEL

Whatever, David!

#### DAVID

Well, they-they Phonitograph Murk.

#### TREXEL

Look, I need to-- I can't just walk into a, a client briefing and be surprised because there's two, or surprised because there's one but they've got two distinct aspects!

#### DAVID

Okay, well-- I don't know! I don't know how wandering extradimensional beings who have been lost in the confines of our miserable four-dimensional space work! [__TREXEL:__ This is just so *typical!*] Yes, they might be possessing-- Archexianniam might be possessing Fugatissiman, *or* Fugatissiman might just be friends with Archexianniam!

#### TREXEL

Let's assume they're friends, because it's really difficult to-- have you ever tried to communicate to a person that's got two aspects, and you're talking to them, and you see their eyes glaze over, and you're like, "oh, we've gone to another aspect now! And they haven't heard anything because they were in another dimension!"

#### DAVID

Isn't that our job?

#### TREXEL

Wha-- it's not our job to be-- __[____crosstalk____]__ to be browbeaten by two people in one body!

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ Isn't that *literally* our job? That-- No, I'm pretty sure that's *literally* our job! If the person is a client, then, well, we do what they want!

#### TREXEL

Oh, I see you're following the *party* line, now, are you?

##### [large, threatening gun emerges from wall, low tone beeping]

#### DAVID

##### [notices gun]

Yes-- Oh! Ha! Aha! Ooh, the guns are pointed at *you!*

#### TREXEL

##### [gun whirrs]

Which I also follow to a T! I just feel that's--  No,I don't feel anything. I follow the party line.

__[____beeping stops, gun retracts, Trexel sighs____]__

#### DAVID [smug]

##### [Trexel grumbles]

##### [more grumbles]

So, are we *agreed*, Trexel, that I am *right*, Trexel, that we should treat these beings with respect regardless of whether they are *two beings* in one body or two beings in two bodies?  Hm? Trexel? Sorry, can I just--  should we be?

#### TREXEL [bitter]

...*Yes*, David. You are absolutely correct, that is the correct way to approach a client. *Respectfully.*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Highroading detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Right! That's good-- Shall we continue, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Why not, David? Why not? Sounds like you've got it allllll worked out.

#### DAVID [pleased sounds of affirmation]

Mm mm.

#### TREXEL [echoes sarcastically]

Mm mm.

#### DAVID

Right. Preferred pronouns are they and them. [__TREXEL:__ Fine.] For the both of them.

#### TREXEL

Fine.

#### DAVID "

Why do they want the planet built?" So, "we are going halfsies," so possibly an important clue, "on a planet built to hold birthday parties for our niece."

#### TREXEL

So they're a cheapskate.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

"Oh, oh, I can't buy a planet for my niece, we have to go halfsies! Because I'm a cheapskate, because I don't really love them."

#### DAVID

Well, that's a question, because they both have the same niece-- who is Rosie Nix, who is turning six-- [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] but they are going halfsies. Which implies maybe two beings-- two separate beings. Right?

#### TREXEL

Maybe they're consciously coupled.

#### DAVID

...Consciously coupled?

#### TREXEL

Consciously coupled beings.

#### DAVID

Consciously coupled?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

What is a conscious coupling?

#### TREXEL

Well, conscious coupling is when you're like, you look at somebody in the eyes and go, "we're coupled". An *un*conscious coupling is when you walk by someone and then suddenly realize you know everything about them because you've made a telekinetic bond by accident.

#### DAVID

Right!

#### TREXEL

It happens more than you'd think!

#### DAVID

Right. Uh-- ooh. That sounds... horrifying.

#### TREXEL

It's real weird! [__DAVID:__ Yes!] You're just, you're suddenly you're eating food, being like, "I don't like this food, why am I eating it?" and you're like, "Gah, I've unconsciously coupled with someone!" [__DAVID:__ Okay?] It's expensive and it hurts!

#### DAVID

Right. Well, let's assume... compromise here... not possessed, not two completely separate beings, a consciously coupled... duo superbeing.

#### TREXEL

Fine. Duo superbeing it is, that I can swallow.

#### DAVID

Okay. So... "Rosie Nix is turning six. She is about to be a 6-year-old human child."

#### TREXEL

Oh, great. So, now we've got consciously coupled multidimensional beings, and they've a--

#### DAVID

##### [scoffs]

Well, I think-- so, Archexianniam [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] is a wandering extradimensional being, specifically. But Fugatissiman--

#### TREXEL

Can we call them Fugu?

#### DAVID

Fugu?

#### TREXEL

I can't manage the Fugu-- Fuga-- the Fuguti--

#### DAVID

Fugatissiman and Archexianniam.

#### TREXEL [sighs]

Fugu and Archie.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Nicknames detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Fugu and Arkie?

#### TREXEL

Sold.

#### DAVID

Right. So, Fugu is a proud Murk-Phonitographer of Marpark-Onkh. [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] Not a clue where Marpark-Onkh is, or--

#### TREXEL

It is a lovely place. It-- what?

#### DAVID

In this dimension? So, it's a four-dimensional place?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, of course.

#### DAVID

Right, so Fuga-- Fugu?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Fugu is a people-person, and Arkie is a, well, extradimensional people-person.

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine. __[____crosstalk____]__ Fine.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

So, we've got a mix. But they've both got a human niece. [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] Right?

#### TREXEL

Look, it's the modern age, David. People do all sorts of crazy things.

#### DAVID

Okay, so "planet must hold at least twenty children of varying sizes and possibly their parents."[__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Parents are optional, it seems. Uh, "also, if you could please include crepe paper streamers, that would be lovely."

#### TREXEL

I see. Okay, so it's a-- it's a basic children's party planet.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Well, we've done a party planet, and we've done a marmalade crèche on a lava world, so just whack 'em together, we're done!

#### DAVID

Wait, no-- then we just designed the planet?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, there you go!

#### DAVID

That's not our job!

#### TREXEL

What.

#### DAVID

We are... sales? We're selling...?

#### TREXEL

I forgot! We're sales now, aren't we?

#### DAVID

You *forgot?*

#### TREXEL

Well, you know, I've got a lot on.

#### DAVID

...Really.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm. And where has-- where have you been in the intervening time? Hm?

#### TREXEL

Oh, around and about.

#### DAVID

At?

#### TREXEL

The...

#### DAVID

Astral?

#### TREXEL

Bar. Yes, well, y-yes, mostly, but I've been doing *work* there, David! I've been working on a new thesis.

#### DAVID

Um, right, and I'm going to regret this, but what is your thesis, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

It is the concept that *maybe*... I am the actual, literal, physical center of the universe.

#### DAVID

Did you internalize the god stuff from yesterday?

#### TREXEL

Mm? Wha-- I just-- I maybe I left with a bit of a... bit of a spring in my step.

#### DAVID

What is your center-of-the-universe name?

#### TREXEL

...Trexel the Mighty.

#### DAVID

...Trexel the Mighty.

#### TREXEL [stutters]

Well, the mouse thing went down so well. They believed *so much* that we were a mouse god!

#### DAVID

Okay. I-- I mean, they did. You're right. They did.

#### TREXEL

And then-- then I went to the Astral Bar and went to the bartender and said, "I am your god! Give me a drink!" And they just sort of sighed and pushed one towards me, which I think means they believed me. So, now I'm just going to sit in there looking, you know, deitific and hope that people bring me things!

#### DAVID

Okay, well--

#### TREXEL

Hence the thesis!

#### DAVID

Well, any extracurricular godhood is not going to help us sell this planet, so let's just, just push that into a box that we never open again.

#### TREXEL

Fine, okay. Fine. Fine.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

A reminder to employees--we make planets but that does *not* make you a god.

#### DAVID

Right, anyway, "tell us about your likes and dislikes." So, uh-- Ah, so this is about Rosie, not about, um-- Fugu and Arkie.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Because the planet's for her. Yes, I understand.

#### DAVID

So, "Rosie enjoys mud; sticks; sweet things- candy, synovial fluids, et cetera; [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and bugs. Especially slugs. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] And being tossed very high in the air. She dislikes broccoli and early bedtimes." Um, "if you were an animal, what would you be?" So, they would be "the illustrious double crested beaver with the name Castor Cristatus."

#### TREXEL

Very specific but okay.

#### DAVID

Right, I don't, I don't know what a double crested beaver is.

#### TREXEL

Well, you know a beaver?

#### DAVID [stammers]

What is a beaver?

#### TREXEL

It's hard to describe really, David. Um, you know, uh--

#### DAVID

Is it that that sort of lumberjack thing?

#### TREXEL

It's like a lumberjack except instead of an axe, you've got a face and you swing your face violently into some wood.

#### DAVID

Right, to do... what?

#### TREXEL

Who can say?

#### DAVID

Right, and, um, what happens when it has double crests?

#### TREXEL

Ah, well this is because the-- Beavers now are quite pompous and have really got into the whole heraldry thing. And, not only that, they've got into double heraldry! "Here's my family arms and your family arms and now they're both my family arms." Double crest.

#### DAVID

Ah, well that makes sense since Fugu and Arkie are sort of, well consciously coupled.

#### TREXEL

It's a consciously coupled crested beaver.

#### DAVID

So, I'm going to assume that is about them and not about Rosie?

#### TREXEL

I understand! Yes, they're actually telling us "what are you? Well in this dimension we present as illustrious double crested beavers."

#### DAVID

Oh! You think they *are* a double crested beaver!

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Let's go ahead on that assumption.

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### TREXEL

So, we are selling-- 'Cause obviously there's two la-- And this is where sales really comes into its own, David. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Because there's two layers here. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] We are selling to one person but the planet's for another.

#### DAVID

Wait.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID "

What is your greatest strength?" Now keep the idea of double crested beavers in your mind.

#### TREXEL

Keeping it.

#### DAVID

Can you see one?

#### TREXEL

I can.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, their greatest strength is "fifty million very strong pairs of ever shifting arms."

#### TREXEL

Oh, that does change things slightly.

#### DAVID

"We can lift very heavy things." Is that a double crested beaver?

#### TREXEL

That, I mean, that-- like, no double crested beaver I've seen but maybe they're a-- a special beaver. A special double crested beaver with millions of arms.

#### DAVID

Fifty millions.

#### TREXEL

They've got to be quite big! Or, the arms are very small like cilia inside your body.

#### DAVID

Eugh! So, they've got sort of--

#### TREXEL

Little wavy cilia arms.

#### DAVID

--lot of really prehensile fur--

#### TREXEL

But they're really strong.

#### DAVID

--that's actually arms. Eugh.

#### TREXEL

So, what, what that means is you've got that all over your body [__DAVID:__ Right.] which means any objects you want you can just sort of like glue them to yourselves and manipulate them. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You can do so many tasks at the same time! [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I'm gone-- I'm doing some basic menial work, but also, I'm writing my thesis about how I'm actually a god on my back!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Not a god!

#### DAVID

That's actually interesting because their greatest weakness is "it can be occasionally difficult for us to maintain a healthy work/life balance."

#### TREXEL

Exactly! When you *can* do that much, *should* you do that much?

#### DAVID

Also--

#### TREXEL

Take care of yourself.

#### DAVID

--occasionally people--

#### TREXEL

David, take care of yourself!

#### DAVID

##### [yelps]

What? Oh!

#### TREXEL

Sorry. Sorry, I...

#### DAVID

Um. I'm just gonna--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating self-care music and lighting.

##### [gentle, calming music starts playing]

#### DAVID

##### [takes a deep breath]

Maybe just-- Um, well, in which case I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna be present for a bit, okay?

#### TREXEL

Okay. I-- Fine then. I mean, we are present.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

I-- no, I--  Just--

#### TREXEL

##### [David gently shushesTrexel]

##### [David shushes again]

You've closed your eyes, David. What's going on? Shush?  Okay, I don't like this but fine.

#### DAVID

I'm just being present. Just--

##### [music plays]

#### TREXEL

##### [music distorts]

Beep! Beep! Beep!  It's time to get on, David.

#### DAVID [sighs]

Right, fine yes, well--

##### [music stops]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Self-care terminated.

#### DAVID [somewhat sarcastically]

##### [normal]

Ooh, I'm so healthy now. Thanks, Trexel. Great.  Um, right. Anyway, so their greatest weakness is "it can occasionally be difficult for us to maintain a healthy work/life balance." Now that implies again that they are kind of inside the same physical form because if they're "maintaining a healthy work/life balance" and this is the same problem they both share in exactly the same way, they're kind of phrasing it like they are sort of a single entity with, um, multiple consciousnesses.

#### TREXEL

Guess what, David? [__DAVID:__ What, ah?] You've stumbled blindly into lesson two of the Trexel Geistman Ten Steps to Sales Domination program.

##### [cheerful jingle]

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Understanding the client. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Now, understanding the client is at the core of what we do, because how can you trick someone if you don't understand them. [__DAVID:__ What--] And, what is sales if not *tricking* people into giving you money!

#### DAVID

Yes, I mean, uh, well, that second part maybe not. But, yes, we have been spending quite a lot of this brief *trying* to understand the cli-- Just, just all of that.

#### TREXEL

You've got to understand *pain* points, David.

#### DAVID

Pain points?

#### TREXEL

And that's where the weakness is. So, their weakness [__DAVID:__ Eugh.] is they don't maintain a healthy work/life balance, and that's where we get them, David! That's where we *exploit* them. That's where we grab them by the very... *nature* of their being and squeeze, David, until the pain is too much and they say, "Augh, here's some money." Because they've got a niece; that's an *emotional, emotional* pain point. And they've got a bad work/life balance and that's a *physical* pain point. And we need to *jab* in there.

#### DAVID [haltingly]

Um... I was going to try and sort of recap that in a sort of way that explained how bad it was, but honestly, I think you know how bad that sounds and--

#### TREXEL

It's not *bad*, David.

#### DAVID

Really??

#### TREXEL

It's commerce! [__DAVID:__ Mhmm.] It's what we do.

#### DAVID

Is commerce bad?

__[____large, threatening gun emerges from wall, low tone beeping____]__

#### DAVID [yelps]

Now the gun's at me!

#### TREXEL

Woah, woah, woah! Woah, now!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Caution. What did you expect was going to happen?

#### DAVID

Uhhh-ahhh...

#### TREXEL

David, even think *slightly* about what you're saying!

#### DAVID

##### [quiet cheering]

Commerce is great and Stellar Firma commerce is brilliant and money going to Stellar Firma is *the best* thing EVER!

__[beeping stops,__ __gun retracts____]__

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [distorted]

##### [normal]

Thin...  *thin*...  ice.

##### [both give relieved sighs]

#### TREXEL [through gritted teeth]

David, are you trying to get us killed?

#### DAVID

No. No.

#### TREXEL

Of course commerce has its... less than positive sides at time, but that's what we are, that's what we *do*!

#### DAVID

But, do we really have to do it so *hard*?

#### TREXEL

Yes... commerce is like a fight. Somebody else comes into the room, they've got your commerce. You want their commerce, so you've got to punch them in the face physically and metaphorically.

#### DAVID

But, so, Fugu and Arkie kind of came here asking *us* for a planet, so can't we just kind of give them what they want [__TREXEL:__ Oh, David.] without manipulating them and threatening their niece?

#### TREXEL

David, David, David. Sweet, innocent, idiotic David.

#### DAVID

Okay, well I was--

#### TREXEL

That's exactly what we have to do.

#### DAVID

No! What, why--

#### TREXEL

They don't know what they want. They think they know what they want, but they don't know what they want so we need to tell them what they want. Don't you remember my *shouting* lesson from before?

#### DAVID

Sure, but, I mean, they've literally asked for what they want. They, they want, they want a party planet for their niece, Rosie Nix.

#### TREXEL

That's basic stuff. That's basic stuff.

#### DAVID

She's turning six!

#### TREXEL

That's basic stuff, David! There's no upsell there. I-- We can, we can knock out a basic party planet at not much expense, and then where are we?

#### DAVID

No, but we could--

#### TREXEL

Selling at low value.

#### DAVID

But, couldn't we upsell things that they've, again, asked for without threatening, again, their niece, Rosie, who is six.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

It's a lot older than me, actually.

#### TREXEL

Yes! A veritable *adult* in comparison to you, you child.

#### DAVID [rejected]

Oh.

#### TREXEL

Alright, fine. David, I'm willing to grow as a person.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Unsubstantiated.

#### TREXEL

So, let's see if we can combine my unassailable, unfailable sales domination plan with your, shall we say, wishy-washy, cuddle arms tactics.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Okay, well I just want to maybe recontextualize *my* approach  a little more because the--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Your wishy-washy, namby-pamby, fluffy bunny world of David 7.

#### DAVID

Just remember, we are going to go into a room-- Oh! Hmm. So, exactly how big was that meeting room?

#### TREXEL

Da-David, we were there yesterday, remember? We were pretending to be gods.

#### DAVID

Yes, but I was very scared, so I had my eyes closed the entire time.

#### TREXEL

The entire time, David?!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I wondered why they kept on looking over at you really confused. I thought it was because, you know, you're just weird.

#### DAVID

Just a scrunch-faced clone.

#### TREXEL

Just a scrunch-faced clone!

#### DAVID

No, didn't open my eyes at all.

#### TREXEL

I'm surprised it worked, David. I'm surprised they bought anything from us with your scrunchy, scrunchy face!

#### DAVID

Well, maybe they liked my scrunchy, scrunchy face.

#### TREXEL

##### [SIGHS]

Well, it's, you know, it's-it's sort of--  What would you call it? Uh, an echoing, intimidating hall of commerce.

#### DAVID

Right, so--

#### TREXEL [interrupts]

Doors twice as high as a human being. Ceilings three times higher than that. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Giant stone tables. Cold, hard furniture, but sumptuous wines and foods. Num num num num.

#### DAVID

Okay, so, in which case, I just-- When we're talking about manipulating them and, and tricking them and things, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] I *just* want to *remind* you [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] that their self-professed greatest strength [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] is their fifty million very strong pairs of ever shifting arms that can lift very heavy things. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh.] So, if we maybe try and manipulate them and it goes wrong, we will be ripped apart.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Ripped apart. Now that-- David, you've hit upon something important. It is a dangerous world, both out there and... in here. So, when you go into a meeting with a client, you've got to accept the fact that they might murder you. You know, they might just straight up murder you. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] You know, before now, you worry about being recycled, you worry about the Board. And yes, they are things to worry about. But now, the client might murder you as well.  Welcome to the next level. Welcome to the next level of sales.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Oh, good. More things, more things, more things to worry about killing me. Brilliant. Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [getting more and more frenzied]

And that thrill, David, that's why I love it.  That thrill, it just, it just gives me a feeling inside, any feeling at all! [__DAVID:__ Oh.] And that's why I do it because it's like flinging yourself [__DAVID:__ Oh, no.] off a cliff into a room. You must win the sales! You must win the business! But at any moment you might be *murdered* by the person across the table! It's a fight, David! Stripped to the waist and oiled up, you fight!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Caution--dangerous mental images detected. You're advised to: remove your imagination.

#### DAVID

This explains a lot.

#### TREXEL

Hmm?

#### DAVID

Okay, so... not dying to the client is good.

#### TREXEL

No client dying for you.

#### DAVID

Yes. Good! Great! I do not want to die to the client. So, can we maybe just roll back, roll back [__TREXEL:__ Fine.] the understanding the client step.

#### TREXEL

How 'bout this, David? How about this?

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

We are trying to understand the client.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And, we are doing that to manipulate them but maybe in a slightly more subtle way than, than I was suggesting which would almost certainly involve our body-ripping murders.

#### DAVID

Yes, so, so let's say we need to upsell them. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] We've got a basic party planet, right? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] So, there are many, many things that you can have at a party.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

Clowns.

#### TREXEL

Add-ons.

#### DAVID

Bigger clowns.

#### TREXEL

Massive clowns.

#### DAVID

Robot clowns.

#### TREXEL

Golden robot gondo-clowns.

#### DAVID

Well, I--

#### TREXEL

I've got an *absolute* load of those golden robot gondoliers hanging around. Once the IMOGEN stuff was taken out of them, they *just went haywire*. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] We had to confiscate *so* many of them, David. And they are just *cluttering* up the storeroom. Paint a face on, put a funny nose, let them in with a group of children.

#### DAVID

Well, well well well well. Okay, so, the things that Rosie enjoys: mud, [__TREXEL:__ Mhm.] sticks, [__TREXEL:__ Eh, okay.] sweet things like candy and synovial fluid, [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] um, and bugs, especially slugs.

#### TREXEL

Candy survival forest.

#### DAVID

What about--

#### TREXEL

Candy survival forest.

#### DAVID

Candy survival forest, yes. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Very wooded, very good.

#### TREXEL

Just drop-- drop them from a helicopter into an incredibly muddy, dangerous forest but all the plants are made of candy. If they live, they'll have fun.

#### DAVID

Right, yes. So, we, we have them, we kind of drop them, uh, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] so, so they can play all these games in this big, uh, sort of candy forest, candy survival forest, right. So, we drop them down and we don't feed them. We don't feed them for *ages*. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] So, they're really-- they're just famished. And we drop them, and they play these series of hungry games. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Right? And all that time, there we have-- So Rosie, she likes bugs and slugs. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] So, what about... golden robot slug clowns?

#### TREXEL

Golden robot slug clowns! We just beat the gold into a big, amorphous shape.

#### DAVID

Yeah, what is a slug except for just- a blob.

#### TREXEL

It's a-- it's-it's so simple. It's so simple it sounds *stupid* but it's *not*. It's genius.

#### DAVID

##### [David makes noises that emphasize the good upselling, Trexel makes noises agreeing with him]

Yes, and they just flop about, maybe in some mud, and then we give all of the children a stick, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] because Rosie likes sticks. [__TREXEL:__ Loves sticks.] But, these sticks-- upselling--  but, positively because she likes sticks. So, these sticks are the best sticks that have ever been.

#### TREXEL

Ohhh, these sticks.

#### DAVID

*Harvested*... harvested from sacred forests. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh.] But, every single stick must come from a different solar system. [__TREXEL:__ Exactly.] So, we find the most holy planet on each solar system, grab the sticks, and in sort of some *giant* cornucopia of sticks, the children can choose their weapon.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Choose from this arcade of holy weapons.

#### DAVID

Right. So-- Ah, ah! So, um, right! Uh, so Fugu and Arkie, they're sitting there. All of their arms are going plubuububublah __[noise made when rapidly moving tongue__ __in and out of mouth]__.

#### TREXEL

I can see it now. I can see it now.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Yes, yes, yes.  And you're pitching--

#### TREXEL

Yes, I'm-- I let them--

#### DAVID

These hungry games.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, these hungry games with holy sticks. Wouldn't you like your niece to be happy? You don't want to disappoint her, do you? Because then she might stop returning your calls.

#### DAVID

##### [loud knocks begin, David startles] [whispers]

Right. Yes. And then we can--  The knocking! The knocking cometh.

#### TREXEL

David. David, it's time.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Now, are you ready?

#### DAVID

I'm going to keep my eyes... I'm going to keep *one* eye open.

#### TREXEL

It's-it's an improvement, David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It's an improvement.

#### DAVID

I'll be winking at Fugu and Arkie. But! But, but, but remember! Fugatissiman... and Archexianniam.

#### TREXEL

Fugu and Archie.

#### DAVID

No. They're probably not going to appreciate that. Fugatissiman

and Archexianniam.

#### TREXEL

F-dog and A-bomb.

#### DAVID [apprehensive and nervous]

##### [quickly]

Better!  Probably they're slightly to rip us apart with their fifty million shifting arms!

#### TREXEL

##### [polite knocking at the door]

Uh, who can say, David?  But that's the thrill. Okay, come with me.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Here we go.

##### [door swings open]

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL [muffled]

Ah! Funk Douglas! Applebam! How's it hanging, you extradimensional mountain of arms?

#### DAVID [nervous]

Oh.
