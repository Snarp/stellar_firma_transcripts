##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [muttering]

Okay, right, okay... let's just get this off.

##### [metallic clank of a hatch being pried open]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Watch it, buster.

##### [pop of suction releasing, followed by a whooshing of air from a suctioning tube]

#### DAVID [struggling noises and muttering through strain]

Ah. There. We. Go!

##### [pop of something going into the suctioning tube][muffled footsteps, growing louder]

#### DAVID

Just close it...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David?!

#### DAVID [startled]

Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ah!

#### TREXEL

David, you are up on my desk!

#### DAVID

Uh, yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

And you're touching the tubes!

#### DAVID

W-- well...

#### TREXEL

David, they're not your tubes.

#### DAVID [nervous sputtering]

#### TREXEL

Are they your tubes?

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Do you own a tube?

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Are you a tube magnet?

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Are you magnetized to a tube, and therefore, you're touching it?

#### DAVID

Uh, no, no.

#### TREXEL

Then why in Board's name are you touching. Our. *Tubes*?!

#### DAVID

Uh-- uh-- uh-- I-- I was cleaning the tubes. [__TREXEL:__ Cleaning?] They were very dirty! See?

#### TREXEL

They are ionized, David. No dust settles on them. Nothing sticks to them.

#### DAVID

Oh, it was a smear.

#### TREXEL

A smear?

#### DAVID

A smear of something. And I've-- I've just... whoop! Wiped it away. See, see, look! There's no smear now.

#### TREXEL

Do you know what I think, David?

#### DAVID

Uh.

#### TREXEL

Do you know what *I* think?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

I think that that smear is from you caressing the tubes.

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### TREXEL

Touching them with your greasy clone hands, saying, "I love you, tube. You're my only friend. I like you *more* than Trexel." Is that it? Do you love the *tubes* more than you love *me*, David?!

#### DAVID

Uh, well...

#### TREXEL

Do I have to *burn* the tubes?

#### DAVID

Well, no, we shouldn't--

#### TREXEL

--Do I have to burn them out of our lives so they don't get between us?!

#### DAVID

We have to submit through the tubes, so we probably shouldn't touch the tubes anymore. Look, I'm--

#### TREXEL

Oh, now we're submitting to the tubes!

#### DAVID

What? No!

#### TREXEL

The tubes are our lord!

#### DAVID

No, we just--

#### TREXEL

They're no lord of mine!

#### DAVID

No, we're submitting the *brief* through the tubes!

#### TREXEL

I am lord!

#### DAVID

Ugh. Yes, okay, you're lord. The tubes will ferry your word to the Build Team. So, they need to... live?

#### TREXEL

The loyal tubes have gained my favor.

#### DAVID

Good. Okay. Right. Now-- now we've sorted out that little political dispute, maybe we should... get on with the brief! Because it's still only 20 minutes before... the end...

#### TREXEL

What's the point, David?

#### DAVID

What do you mean what the point is?!

#### TREXEL

We know where this is going.

#### DAVID

Well, no, the point is--

#### TREXEL

You heard Hartro.

#### DAVID

Yes, but the point is I don't want to die!

#### TREXEL

Well, now, nobody wants to die!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I've never met anyone who wants to die.

#### DAVID

Well--

#### TREXEL

I never asked anybody about their feelings or thoughts, but, you know!

#### DAVID

Well, I'm telling you: I don't want to die! And the way you do that is we submit good planets! Okay? So let's get the brief on, let's pull our fingers out, let's do a good job like we haven't done!

#### TREXEL

Alright, David. I'll engage in your charade. Your *sad* [__David sighs__] puppet show inching towards death. But I'm a professional! And I will help you.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, in your prof--

#### TREXEL

You're welcome.

#### DAVID

Fine. Yes. Okay, well, in your professional opinion, how do we solve *this* problem?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Here's the brief! Right. We have a submission from Cardinal Fang. Umm. They want a planet that--

#### TREXEL

From who?

#### DAVID

C-Cardinal Fang?

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

...Cardinal Fang.

#### TREXEL

I knew this day would come.

#### DAVID

Okay. Do you want to maybe listen to what they--

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang...

#### DAVID

--want?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

The Dark Rider.

#### DAVID

Uh.

#### TREXEL

The Shadow Minister.

#### DAVID

Uhhh.

#### TREXEL

Undersecretary for Death.

#### DAVID

Oooh!

#### TREXEL

The Nine Night Knight.

#### DAVID

Um.

#### TREXEL

The Spoken One.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Cleaning the Streets of Dirt. Do not defy Cardinal Fang.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

He ministers to your very soul.

#### DAVID

Uh.

#### TREXEL

He ministers to your dreams.

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

He takes your dreams. He turns them dreamlike into further dreams then puts them back into your head, and you're like, "Are they my dreams?"Cardinal Fang!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang! Lord of Hypnos!

#### DAVID

Really?!

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang... Lord of All.

#### DAVID

Oh... okay.

#### TREXEL [suavely]

Cardinal Fang.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Well, *they* are our client...

#### TREXEL

Oh, what do they want?

#### DAVID

Umm, well, they want this planet built because no one will expect it! Um, oh--

#### TREXEL

That's just like Cardinal Fang.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Foam Trumpet.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

The Unexpected Noise.

__TREXEL [whispering____] and IM____OGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Okay... And the one on--

#### TREXEL

Under your mattress! You hear a creaking. You think it's just the wind rustling at the eaves of your old country shack. You open a cabinet to get a glass of water out that you put in there earlier. Who do you see?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Okay, I have to ask: what is Cardinal Fang's actual job?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Keeper of Records. Knower of All.

#### DAVID

Okay.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

For Stellar Firma, or...?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Gatekeeper to the Maintenance Closet of Life.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Right, so whose maintenance closet is this?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Upkeep Minister of the Third Trimester.

#### DAVID

O--

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

--kay. So, he's some kind of obstetrician?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Beyond Gynecology.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang--

#### TREXEL

--M.D.

#### DAVID

S-- Okay. So, he's got a medical degree.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Long-term Academic. Ph.D. in Everything.

##### [elongated and digitized]

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal *Fang*!

#### DAVID

Right. Well, the one thing they absolutely want to have on this planet is a comfy chair.

#### TREXEL

Well, you know, everybody likes comfort.

#### DAVID

Right--

#### TREXEL

Even Cardinal Fang!

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Relaxer of Their Legs.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Everybody needs a nice sit down.

__TREXEL [whispering] and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Okay, well, you seem to know a lot about Cardinal Fang, so that's just...

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang, you say?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Administrator to My Neurons! Justica!

#### DAVID

Okay so that's just--

#### TREXEL

Templar!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Avatar.

#### DAVID

Uh-- Mhm.

#### TREXEL

Guiding Star.

#### DAVID [whispering]

Right.

#### TREXEL

Temple Bar.

#### DAVID

Okay... Right.

#### TREXEL

So they want an unexpected planet that nobody will expect, and the only thing they need? A comfy chair.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

If you're going to have an unexpected surprise, it means you don't know when the surprise is going to 'prise. Is that how that works? I want a surprise! It just 'prised! I'm not sure, but it's not important. So you want somewhere comfy to wait, sure. So we need to build this world out from that core ideal. A comfy chair. What is a comfy chair? You know chairs, David, don't you?

#### DAVID

Um. Well, I know one chair. This chair.

#### TREXEL

What's it like, David? Describe your chair to me.

#### DAVID

Uhm. Well, it's-- it's plastic.

#### TREXEL

Mhm.

#### DAVID

Uh, it's blue.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

It's very slippery.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well that's not the chair's fault, now is it, David? That's more your secretions.

#### DAVID

Well... maybe. But as I say, I only know one chair, and this chair is slippery.

#### TREXEL

Well, you're a gooey boy.

#### DAVID

Yes. There's some sort of drainage funnel in the bottom, um, for the, for the goo.

#### TREXEL

And also, if I was to let something out, that would also be handled by this drainage funnel.

#### DAVID

Okay, so, it's a multi--

#### TREXEL

As we know, occasionally we have accidents and we don't like to dwell on them.

#### DAVID

Yes, so...You're... You're dwelling, aren't you?

#### TREXEL

I just, ah, you know, it was so hard to clean them.

#### DAVID

*Well*... all we can say is good--

#### TREXEL

It was everywhere!

#### DAVID

--good thing the chair had a drainage--!

#### TREXEL

##### [sniff sniff]

People were looking at me, David! As I walked down the halls, they were saying,  "What's that?"

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

"Oh. Geistman."

#### DAVID

Well. Maybe we'll keep a spare pair of trousers in the office. But! It's a good thing--

#### TREXEL

Imagine if I were wearing a onesie! Wh-- what would happen then? I'd have to cut it off at the waist!

#### DAVID

...I don't want to think about that.

#### TREXEL

Neither do I.

#### DAVID

But I do want to think about the chair's drainage tube!

#### TREXEL

Yes. The drainage tube.

#### DAVID

So, I find that quite useful, because otherwise the goo would pile up and puddle up and pour over and--

#### TREXEL

Here's a thought:__ ...__You're waiting in your comfy chair for people to come across your surprise planet so you can say, "Ha ha! You've been surprised."

#### DAVID

Okay! So, you think that Cardinal Fang *wants* people to *find* their planet?

#### TREXEL

No good having a surprise if no one finds it!

#### DAVID

Okay. So this planet needs to be very findable?

#### TREXEL

There's a--

#### DAVID

Or very unexpected?

#### TREXEL

There's a fine balance. Ooh! I know! It's easy to find but not what you expect!

#### DAVID

Right! So what would people expect from Cardinal Fang? You seem to know a lot about their name.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

You know what you're getting.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

But is that what they want you to think?

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Uh. Good questions. And something we need to answer.

__TREXEL [slightly more slowly] and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

##### [scoff]

As I live and metabolize.You know. I've always loved Cardinal Fang.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Okay, let's-- let's play a game then, a-- about Cardinal Fang. Uh, maybe: what if I start a sentence about Cardinal Fang--

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

--and you tell me what the end of the sentence is?

#### TREXEL

Okay. Do you want me to *be* Cardinal Fang while I'm doing this?

#### DAVID

Uhh. Will that help or make it quicker?

#### TREXEL

Let's make it an interview format. You've managed to secure an interview with Cardinal Fang.

#### DAVID

Okay.

__TREXEL and IMOGEN: [beep]__ Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

This is unprecedented. They never do interviews. They are mysterious. They are unknowable. You're a... a young up-and-coming journalist. This is a *huge* get for you, David! A *huge* get! You've got your little hat on with the word 'press' written on a, on a piece of paper tucked into the band for some reason--

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Like some sort of ticket thing, I know, yeah.

#### TREXEL

I don't know what it's for! Sometimes it just says 'three and thr-- thrappens' or something. It's not important. But you-- you've-- you're across the table--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--from Cardinal Fang.

##### [beep]

__IMOGEN__:  Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

You're nervous. Your bowels clench.

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### TREXEL

Your buttocks *squeeze*--

#### DAVID

O... kay...?

#### TREXEL

##### [in a slightly lower voice, imitating Cardinal Fang]

--as, as they sit down, looking across and say,  "What do you wanna know from Cardinal Fang?"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

##### [clears throat]

Right, okay, yes, so...

#### TREXEL

##### [same low voice continues in quotes]

"Come on. Come on. I haven't got all day."

#### DAVID

Cardinal Fang--

#### TREXEL

"I'm doing Cardinal Fang's accent."

#### DAVID

--Okay. Uh, so. Cardinal. Fang.

#### TREXEL

"Yes."

#### DAVID

Uh. When you are at home on the weekend, what do you like to do?

#### TREXEL

"I like to look out at the stars and contemplate the fate... of man."

#### DAVID

Okay. Well. Turns out Sunday's rolled around. Oop! You let the weekend get away from you! What's the last thing you do Sunday evening before you've got to start your work on Monday?

#### TREXEL

"Well I like to heat up a glass of milk. Then pour it across the floor, scatter beads into it, and consider that is how the firmament came to be."

#### DAVID

Okay... And, uh, and is--

#### TREXEL

"Your questions are insolent and childish."

#### DAVID

O-- ok--

#### TREXEL

"I will end you!"

#### DAVID

What? That, no, that's not really that necessary, I'll just--

#### TREXEL

"Your matter will come apart, and I will breathe it into my lungs, for I am Cardinal Fang!"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

"Cardinal Fang."

#### DAVID

So... should I just go?

#### TREXEL

"No, keep going, I like it."

#### DAVID

Okay. Ah. Well. What's your favorite color?

#### TREXEL

"Azure."

#### DAVID

...Good! And if you could do anything for 24 hours, what would it be?

#### TREXEL

##### [growing increasingly louder and more frenzied]

"Sleep. Sleep and let the terrible voices of knowledge quiet from me. I cannot *not* hear them. They scream in the eternal darkness of my subconscious. We live. We die. You watch. You sit. You stand. You point. You know but cannot touch! You hear but cannot speak! I have a mouth and yet as I scream nothing changes!! *All ends and continues!!*

__TREXEL [screaming] and IMOGEN [in a digitally lowered voice]__: Cardinal Fang!!!

#### DAVID

And: scene!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Okay, I liked that, that was quite nice.

#### DAVID

I think we got something there--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--which is: the comfy chair needs to be a sleeping chair to, um, quiet--

#### TREXEL

To have a little nap.

#### DAVID

--um, the voices of knowledge?

#### TREXEL

A little nippy nap from those, from those voices. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Got quite-- got quite angry at the end there, didn't old Cardinal Fang?

#### DAVID

Yes, uh, I do hope that was accurate. You *do* know a lot about Cardinal Fang, right?

#### TREXEL

Oh, I just went completely unconscious during that. I assume Cardinal Fang, being interested in this process, just nabbed my body. The minute I said "I'll inhabit Cardinal Fang" or something to that effect, my vision went black, I felt sort of sleepy, and then I woke up and said, "How was that?"

#### DAVID

Right...

#### TREXEL

Did you speak with Cardinal Fang?

#### DAVID

Um... yes?

#### TREXEL

Lovely. How were they?

#### DAVID

...Scary.

#### TREXEL

Ah! I've always liked Cardinal Fang.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

But what they said is, yes, they like to sit down, and spreading glasses of milk across the floor and putting beads into it.

#### TREXEL

Common pastime. A common pastime for beings that know the universe. Oddly, just pouring a glass of milk on the floor and scattering stuff into it, you know, that's a common thing. 'Cause it's very much like how the firmament came to be.

#### DAVID

Oh, well that's what Cardinal Fang was doing. Hang on, Trexel, is this something you do?

#### TREXEL

Beg pardon?

#### DAVID

Is this something that you do?

#### TREXEL

I don't even pretend to be up to the caliber of Cardinal Fang, but I do consider myself somewhat of an all-knowing being. How could I be such a good consultant if I wasn't so all-knowing? So yes, I-- I have been known to knock over the glass or two of reconstituted lactose-filled water under my desk and just, well, pop a couple of crumbs in there and do my own little, my own little firmament gazing of time and I see the-- the crumbs, they soak up the milk and they expand--

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Crush them, eat them, lick them...

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Yeah, no that's-- Yes. Right. And, okay. Yeah-- Right.

#### TREXEL

Sorry! Sorry! Vision started to go there again.

#### DAVID

Right. And just... uh. Just a check, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes, you.

#### DAVID

If you were to have 24 hours free, would you like to sit in a chair and sleep?

#### TREXEL

I'd *love* to sit in a chair and sleep. Would the chair have a cup holder? I'd need a cup holder, of course.

#### DAVID

Well, for your milk, yes.

#### TREXEL

And also, another one for my cocktail.

#### DAVID

Okay, two cup holders.

#### TREXEL

Or maybe a cocktail involving *milk*.

#### DAVID

Wait, hang on a minute. We're not designing a chair for you. What I mean is, if you'd like to have a sit-down for 24 hours and sleep--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--why would you do that?

#### TREXEL

Why would I do that?

#### DAVID

Yes. Why would you, Trexel, do that?

#### TREXEL

Oh, yeah. To quiet the voices.

#### DAVID

Okay, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

Were you just saying what you want to do but in Cardinal Fang's voice?

#### TREXEL

No, no. You-- you-- you met Cardinal Fang.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Right...

#### TREXEL

That was absolutely Cardinal Fang.

#### DAVID

##### [suspicious]

Do you know Cardinal Fang?

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yeah, me and Cardinal Fang, we go way back.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Oh, Cardinal Fang. Old Cardy F. Fang Boi. The Fang Man. The Fang-Meister General.

#### DAVID

So, those titles you knew about Cardinal Fang?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Well obviously they're real.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

So, would you mind repeating them all?

#### TREXEL

Um.

#### DAVID

Would you mind repeating one of them?

#### TREXEL

Uh, okay.

#### DAVID

Cardinal Fang the...

#### TREXEL

...Fang-Fang... Fang-Meister General?

#### DAVID

I don't think that was one of them.

#### TREXEL

That was-- that was the last one I did. It's Fang-Meister General.

#### DAVID

##### [beat]

Okay. Well, let's do another. Do you know who Cardinal Fang is?

#### TREXEL [quietly]

Yes.

#### DAVID

Okay, so, who-- who is Cardinal Fang?

#### TREXEL

A friend of mine!

#### DAVID

A friend of yours?

#### TREXEL

A good... a good close friend of mine! Me and Cardinal Fang go *way* back.

#### DAVID

Right. Maybe you could just tell us some fun things that you and Cardinal Fang did when you were children.

#### TREXEL

Well, yes, yes, yes. Of course. Of course, if we're childhood friends, we go all the way back to the-- to the very start, then yes. Of course I can.

#### DAVID

And one of those would be...?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you want to hear-- you want to hear one-- you want to hear one right now?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [beginning to grow upset]

Okay. Okay. We were. Children. Together. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] We were playing in a field of wheat. [__DAVID:__ Right.] The wheat was up to *my head* and up to their neck because they're a little taller than me. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And they were saying, "Oh, Trexel! You're my best childhood friend! But I... am destined to be an unknowable being. So, one day, I'm going to grow up and I'm going to stop returning your calls and messages. And you're going to tell people that we were childhood friends and, while that is *absolutely true and 100% a thing*, if they say things like, 'Well, why don't you call them?' or 'Tell me about what they've been up to lately, given that you're such a close friend," I won't reply. And I won't have replied for many, many years and therefore your complete lack of contact with me later on in life is completely justifiable and absolutely something that doesn't mean  that we've never known each other and that you're only saying that you know me because you think it makes you look important!"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning. Consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL

"An important consultant with contacts. Like Cardinal Fang."

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

Silencing topic.

#### TREXEL [yelling, emotional]

##### [vague crying noises]

Cardinal Fang! Opener of Doors! Climber of Ladders! Friend of Yours! Because you're important, Trexel! You're important and people respect you and they-- and they love you! And when they close their eyes at night they think, "Why aren't I more like Trexel Geistman?! Because he's such a great guy!"

#### DAVID

Okay. And: scene. And: scene. And: scene. And: scene.

#### TREXEL [whispers]

He's such a great guy.

#### DAVID

And: scene.

#### TREXEL

Have you got a glass of slurry for me?

#### DAVID

Uh... I can't do--

#### TREXEL

Consultant slurry. Consultant slurry.

#### DAVID

Well, I can't-- I can't get the consultant slurry!

#### TREXEL

Get it!

#### DAVID

No. We have established--

#### TREXEL [screams]

Get me some consultant slurry!

#### DAVID

No! Get your own consultant slurry!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sass detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL [surprise]

What?

#### DAVID

Get your own consultant slurry.

#### TREXEL [distressed]

I'm in charge here.

#### DAVID

I can't get consultant slurry! It shocks me!

#### TREXEL

You should try though!

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Try!

#### DAVID

I-- No! I'm not trying to get you consultant slurry.

#### TREXEL

##### [voice breaking]

Why are you doing this to me? [__DAVID:__ Because...] Why are you hurting me like this, David? I am a victim here. You're coming and picking me apart at my very edges. What, what, out of some sort of power trip, David?!

#### DAVID

You picked yourself apart! I didn't even do anything! All I did was ask you some questions and then you had a sudden spiral!

#### TREXEL

##### [imitating David]

Exactly! You ask *questions*, David! You pick and you can't just accept that maybe, maybe Cardinal Fang likes me. And that we're friends. You're like,  "Oh, oh! How do you know him? How do you know him?"

#### DAVID

##### [with contempt]

We have about one minute left of this shift, which you turned up to... with only 20 minutes left of this shift and you spent the vast majority of it pretending that you knew the client!

#### TREXEL [laughing, voice taking on a bitter tone]

Oh, it's easy to point the finger of blame! I warned you about the blame game, David. I warned you about that game. You want to play the game, David? You want to play the blame game? I'm going to have to play the blame game with you, David.

#### DAVID [voice also taking on a bitter tone]

Right. Let's play the blame game.

#### TREXEL

Let's play the blame game. Let's play this game-game.

#### IMOGEN

Blame Game: initiated.

##### [dramatic musical sting, like the intro of some high-pressure game show]

#### DAVID

So whose fault is this?

#### TREXEL

This is your fault, David. Do you know why?

#### DAVID

No, I don't, *Trexel*.

#### TREXEL

I am a constant! I am a constant in this process. There's no two ways around it, David. I'm going *nowhere*. So you can do whatever you want. But the results, David, the results are down to *you*. You can't blame me! I'm like gravity! Or falling over when somebody attractive is looking at you.

#### DAVID [very done with this]

Okay. Fine. We have twenty seconds left. It's a ball. With a chair.

#### TREXEL

A ball with a chair.

#### DAVID

A big chair.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, let's submit that.

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### TREXEL

A big ball-chair planet.

#### DAVID

*Four* cup holders.

#### TREXEL

Four cup holders.

#### DAVID

And a head rest.

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

And it goes flat like a bed.

#### TREXEL

Why not?

#### DAVID

Brilliant.

#### TREXEL

Pop it in the tube.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

Will do. There it goes.

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

#### IMOGEN

Submitting!

##### [pop of it being submitted]

#### DAVID

*Great*.

#### TREXEL

You happy, David? Because I'm happy. Because you know what we've had? A breakthrough.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Conflict is the soul of friendship.

#### DAVID

O... kay.

#### TREXEL

And I, I feel like... I feel like we've become friends, David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Adversity breeds friendship.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Friendship: established.__ ...__Security: alerted.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, that was--

#### TREXEL

My friend. David 7.

#### DAVID

Me. Yes. Okay. So, while--

#### TREXEL

Employee-friend.

#### DAVID

Okay. Yeah-- fine.

#### TREXEL

I'm still angry that you wouldn't get me slurry.

#### DAVID

Sure. But. Okay, so now we've had this breakthrough, maybe, *maybe*, if you come in, for a favor for a friend, me, David 7, a little earlier and we work on the planet and you--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

That's reasonable.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

That's totally reasonable, David.

#### DAVID

Okay!

#### TREXEL

You just-- You know, for a friend. For a friend in need. For a friend that, if this doesn't go well, will be literally killed.

#### DAVID

Yes, that's me.__TREXEL:__ And who wouldn't do that for a friend, David?

#### DAVID

Yes, who wouldn't do that?

#### TREXEL

Who? Who amongst us would turn up just, just even ten minutes earlier for a friend.

#### DAVID

Yes. Even ten minutes.

#### TREXEL

Like, what-- How is that-- What do they got on?

#### DAVID

N-- nothing, probably.

#### TREXEL

Probably. They'd probably just be sleeping, or crying. Or probably sleeping and not crying.

#### DAVID

Yes, sleeping, right. Fine. So they can just put their alarm on--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--a little earlier--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--and come in a little earlier--

#### TREXEL

That's reasonable.

#### DAVID

--and stop their friend from being killed.

#### TREXEL

Anybody would do that.

#### DAVID

Good. So I'll see you tomorrow.

#### TREXEL

At a certain time, yes.

#### DAVID

Okay...

#### TREXEL

##### [in a strange, presumably intended to be birdlike voice]

I will turn up... a little earlier. But, David, I'm a creative. And so I can't guarantee-- I'm flighty, David. I'm flighty. Like a bird. Like a bird! Flap flap! Flap flap! Give me seed!

#### DAVID

I will take seven and a half hours late over seven hours and forty minutes late.

#### TREXEL

Okay. I'll do that. I'm making that commitment to you. Tomorrow, I am turning up. A little bit earlier. And if I don't, David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

And if I don't.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You know that's because I'm a *liar*.

#### DAVID

Okay.__TREXEL:__ A word is a consultant's bond. And if I break that word. Then I am a liar.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Shift's over.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

See you tomorrow. Friend.

#### TREXEL

See you tomorrow. *Friend. Buddy.*

#### DAVID

...Pal.

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang!

#### DAVID

Okay, no, we're not doing this anymore!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Cardinal Fang! Knower of Time! Arriver of Clocks! Alarm Lowerer!

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

##### [tube]

##### [metallic shutting]

Okay, he's gone. Well he's definitely not turning up tomorrow. Maybe at all. Anyway, I should go get that brief. Right. Here we go.  Right. Okay  Now to get some *actual* work done.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN online. How can I help you...

#### DAVID [recorded]

Um... David 7?

#### DAVID

Access design brief records.

#### IMOGEN

Accessing design brief records.

#### DAVID

They should be... somewhere. Ah. Here. Okay. Date and time logs.

#### IMOGEN

Accessing date time logs.

#### DAVID

Find user: Trexel Geistman.

#### IMOGEN

Searching.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN

Search: complete.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Edit design submission time codes.

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

Access denied.

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

#### DAVID

Ahh, um. Uhh... use universal permissions.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Access granted.

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

#### IMOGEN

Permission to edit.

#### DAVID

##### [laughs]

I don't believe it! It actually worked.  Now I have the brief and I can make good without Trexel ruining it or shouting at me. Then I can just edit the time codes and no one will know we missed the deadline... And I... I won't die.
