##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David... David, look at you.

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Look at you there... a proud clone, all grown up now!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Because d'you know what today is, David?

#### DAVID

Today is... Thursday.

#### TREXEL

It's the final day... of the Trexel Geistman Ten Steps to Sales Domination Program.

##### [cheerful jingle]

#### TREXEL

##### [wistfully]

Remember back on day one, David? Me, yelling. You, also yelling. So young, the both of us, so... innocent, so... unable to imagine what would happen!

#### DAVID

That was--

#### TREXEL

But now we're here.

#### DAVID

That was three weeks ago.

#### TREXEL

Together. More haggard, certainly.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

We've been through a lot, sure. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] But together, we've grown. And you...

#### DAVID

That's fair.

#### TREXEL

...are about to become a fully-fledged salesperson.

#### DAVID

Oh, good.

#### TREXEL

At the end of today, you will have a full and official sales qualification--

#### DAVID

Official?

#### TREXEL

--from Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### DAVID

##### [hopefully]

Really?

#### TREXEL

And that means a lot, David.

#### DAVID

It does!

#### TREXEL

Everything in Stellar Firma is done on awards, qualifications, and grade point averages.

#### DAVID

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

And you'll start to... see yourself step up in the world with something like this, David.

#### DAVID

Oh right, okay, um... well, um, great! Erm... in which case, what is the-- what is the tenth lesson?

#### TREXEL

The tenth lesson?

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Closing. Of course, David, what else could it be? You've got them where you want them, but if you can't close, it's not worth a damn thing.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Potentially, not even then.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But what does that *mean?*

#### DAVID

Closing?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Um... ending the deal.

#### TREXEL

Sure, in a way. Anything else?

#### DAVID

Uhhh... making them sign the paper bit?

#### TREXEL

Absolutely! But how do you *do* that?

#### DAVID

Asking nicely.

#### TREXEL

No, no, that doesn't seem like it would be the answer, David.

#### DAVID

Giving them what they want so that they *want* to sign the piece of paper.

#### TREXEL

We've discussed that, that's a bad way to go...

#### DAVID

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

It's threats.

#### DAVID

Rrright.

#### TREXEL

It's threats, David. You can be as nice as you want, but in the end? They've gotta have a bit of pressure on them, David! So you've gotta have a little threat. Now, I know *we* have, *together,* learnt that... direct hostility and malice is not always the way to go! [__DAVID:__ Right.] But I still feel *very* strongly, David, that-- that very delicate point, right at the end there?

#### DAVID

Uh-huh?

#### TREXEL

You've gotta threaten a little bit! However you want to do that. To really get people to commit, because the thing people don't really want to do is commit on the dotted line.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

They walk up to the precipice and they think, "Ahh, *do* I want to do this? Was that schmoozing genuine? Ah, I don't actually think this *is* this person's last day alive, I think they're lying!" And at that point, that's where you've got to threaten them... to just seal the deal.

#### DAVID

Right. And you're saying that I'll get a qualification out of this at the end?

#### TREXEL

Yes, absolutely!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right, well, let's, uh... great! Yeah, let's get on with it. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Let's get on with, um... threat and closing.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Misplaced faith detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Oh, actually, how did your... schmoozing with Yinly go?

#### TREXEL

It-- hah. Uh, it, ah... it didn't go *amazingly* well, David. [__DAVID:__ Right.] I-- I'm *banned* from a lot more places than I thought I was banned from.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

'Cause normally, I'm crawling in a ventway! There's nobody at the door! They don't know I'm in there until it's too late and something's on fire! And then I'm being kicked out anyway, so I dunno. But going in the front door with a client on my arm, a lot of times it was, "*Who the hell* *do you think you are?* Get out!" And that looked bad in front of the client. I got into a lot of fights, a lot of fights. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And I won *none* of them.

#### DAVID

Did Yinly win any of them?

#### TREXEL

Yinly really had my back. We got into a lot more places than we should have because of those powerful arms. And turns out, she did have a wheel.

#### DAVID

Ah! Ah.

#### TREXEL

She could just run them down. [__DAVID:__ Right, well...] Run and punch.

#### DAVID

Good. Well, good for her.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Flesh wheel murder suspect list updated. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

So, I am banned from even more places now.

#### DAVID

Oh! Oh, yeah.

#### TREXEL

But, uh, you know... we had some fun, we had some drinks. I think Yinly was onside but, uh, yeah, not, not on a 100% success.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, you know, we-- I guess take it.

#### TREXEL

But I do 100% confess to having had a great time.

#### DAVID

Good! That's good to hear, Trexel. It's nice that you schmoozed properly instead of, you know, the veil of tears.

#### TREXEL

I liked it.

#### DAVID

Veil of fun was better, right?

#### TREXEL

It was a veil of fun. I liked it.

#### DAVID

Veil of fun.

#### TREXEL

It was good.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, anyway, so this is our, our next brief. Our final brief for the, the course, so, you know, after on Monday, after the review it'll be--

#### TREXEL

You'll be a fully-fledged salesperson. You'll-- you'll be leading things, David.

#### DAVID

Wwwhaa--?

#### TREXEL

You'll be leading things.

#### DAVID

##### [excited]

Really?!

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

A qualification comes with certain responsibilities. I'll be there, David. *Don't you worry, you're not getting rid of me that way!*

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### TREXEL

But I'll be in the corner. The mentor. The aged one sitting in the corner, nodding along. Shaking my head suddenly because I disagree with something. Realising I misunderstood, leaning back and nodding again.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

"Yes, I taught him everything he knows."

#### DAVID

Well, there wasn't any shouting so it's an improvement. Okay, well--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

--our brief is for Ethel Unction Yeems.

#### TREXEL

Ethel Unction Yeems.

#### DAVID

Ethel Unction Yeems.

#### TREXEL

That's-- that's-- that's a good, that's a good name.

#### DAVID

Yeah. Uh, well, her pronouns are she/her.

#### TREXEL

Good.

#### DAVID

Um, she wants a planet built for the ongoing education and social erudition of young sentients who have, quite frankly, forgotten their manners.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

Um, she likes order, neatness, straight lines, folded sheets, please and thank you, respect for your elders, and clean hands.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

She dislikes filth--

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm

#### DAVID

--rot--

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

--speaking out of turn--

#### TREXEL

##### [loudly]

Well, that's not--

#### DAVID

--and that look you are giving me right now, young man!

#### TREXEL

How did she know?!

#### DAVID

How did she know? If she were an animal, she would be a noble swan.

#### TREXEL

Big, long neck.

#### DAVID

Her greatest strength is her sense of what is right, and her greatest weakness is other people's *rrrrudeness!*

#### TREXEL

Right, so this person is a *real* pain. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] You invite them 'round and they've got a problem with everything. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] "This napkin isn't folded properly! This meat isn't at the proper temperature! This isn't a knife; this is driftwood you've carved the word 'why?' into." You know, [__DAVID:__ Why?] just, just putting all of, of their energy into nitpicking and finding problems where there aren't problems. [__DAVID:__ Right.] "Oh, the toliet's overflowing, Trexel! Please, call a plumber." "Oh, I've got dysentery, Trexel. I think I'm dying." "Oh, Trexel. Trexel, there's an out-of-control oil fire in your kitchen--" Waah waah waah, you know.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Dinner party watch list updated. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

I'm just trying to have a party, David!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And maybe I want the oil to be on fire! Do you ever think about that?

#### DAVID

Was the oil on fire?

#### TREXEL

It was on fire, yes!

#### DAVID

What happened to the fire?

#### TREXEL

Eh, it got out of control.

#### DAVID

And did that person die of dysentery?

#### TREXEL

No no, they died of fire.

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right. Um... r-rest in peace, I suppose.

#### TREXEL

Eh. So the thing is, when you're dealing with someone like this, David, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] you need to really inoculate yourself against their nitpickery, because it's very quickly easy to go from "okay, I'm dealing with this" to "okay, I'm hitting you until the struggling stops".

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. And, um, and that is closing something but not the deal.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

This is *nothing* to do with the Sales Domination Plan, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] This is about simply getting through a meeting with somebody that's gonna have a problem-- "Oh, your tie's the wrong length. Oh look, those pleats are wrong--" *Shut up, mother! I'm not a boy anymore, I'm a big man!*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Physically, yes. Emotionally, no.

#### TREXEL

And my pleats are my business!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Why didn't you say you loved me before you died??

#### DAVID

Um...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Yikes!

#### TREXEL

You just talked about pleats! And then one day you were gone. And what did you leave? A son who knew that you loved him? No. A son who knew that you disapproved of his pleats.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Oh, sure, you were respected, but you didn't have *my* respect.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

That's why father left.

#### DAVID

Have you considered therapy?

#### TREXEL

A-what-a-thy?

#### DAVID

A therapy.

#### TREXEL

I don't know...

#### DAVID

Uh--

#### TREXEL

...what that is.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Oh, right. Well, a therapy is, um, well, IMOGEN has quite a few programs. It's when you sort of talk to her about... what you're feeling and then she'll give you some exercises or ways of thinking about things and... maybe to help.

#### TREXEL

I'm gonna allow you to take a moment to think about everything you know about me, David, and everything I've ever said and done in your presence. And then I'm gonna let you think about the question "is Trexel gonna talk about his feelings to IMOGEN?"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN votes no.

#### DAVID

Well, I am going to also think about what we talked about yesterday and is this a 10 out of 10 kind of thing to do [__TREXEL:__ Ooohh...] or a 1 to 3 kind of thing to do?

#### TREXEL

This feel-- it's sub 5, David. It doesn't feel good. I'm feeling very hostile. I'm feeling very defensive and that defensiveness feels safe. Yes, I feel very safe in that place, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] but do I feel good? No, I don't, I don't feel good but I-- I'm scared, I'm scared to, to try and change because maybe if I change I won't like what I change into so maybe I should just stay the same even though I'm still unhappy.

#### DAVID

Then you'll always be unhappy, and you should probably give yourself the chance to be happy.

#### TREXEL

I should give myself the chance... to be happy.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN still votes no.

#### DAVID

And do you know what we just did there?

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

We talked about your feelings.

#### TREXEL [gasps]

You tricked me!

#### DAVID

Oh wait, no.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk] [yells]

*You tricked me! I will not be tricked in this way! Give me back my feelings!*

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

##### [David and Trexel struggle, a glass breaks]

##### [Trexel sucks up something]

No. No no no! That was-- It was-- No, it was a good-- No, it was a good-- Ah, no, I don't keep them anywhere! You have your feelings. No, stop sucking on my nose! Bleh! Eugh, that's horrible!

#### TREXEL

##### [David makes sounds of disgust]

I think I got some feelings. It could be snot. Ah! Ah, that's not nice. That's not nice.

#### DAVID

Well, now--eugh!--now you've got your feelings back, um, maybe we could-- [__TREXEL:__ Blech.] Oh!--get back to Ethel Unction Yeems.

#### TREXEL

Oh yes, and the lesson!

#### DAVID

And the lesson.

#### TREXEL

Closing equaling threats.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So, we need to know what to threaten this person about. Now, we could, obviously, apply all of the other tactics that we have learnt about.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes.

#### TREXEL

Uh, spying--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--lying--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--pretending that you're going to die.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

All of these things could be useful but, luckily in this particular instance, [__DAVID:__ Right.] we've quite a few things from Ethel that she doesn't like that we can threaten her about.

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

So, let's just, let's just run through those things again, shall we?

#### DAVID

Right, so what does she like? She likes order.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

She likes neatness.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

She likes straight lines.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Folded sheets.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

She likes pleases and thank yous.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

Uh, she likes respecting your elders.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

And she likes clean hands.

#### TREXEL

So, it turns out, David, that I am everything that she hates and fears. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] I am like a walking threat to this person. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I walk into the room; I don't even have to say anything. They take one look and think, "Uh-oh, this person is a whirlwind of sadness and crooked lines." So, you just need to use me, David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Like a weapon!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You need to pierce her heart with the sword point of *me*!

#### DAVID

Okay, then we just need to make sure that there-- she doesn't have a way to, you know, run away immediately.

#### TREXEL

Oh, we can lock the doors.

#### DAVID

Oh. We could just--

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

#### TREXEL

For this next session make sure that the exit door for the consultant is locked.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Securing meeting room. None may escape our clutches!

#### TREXEL

And there you go.

#### DAVID

Alright, it was-- it was that easy.

#### TREXEL

It's always been an option, David.

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

It's just normally people don't like it when the door locks behind them. [__DAVID:__ Sure.] It makes them, oh, tense I suppose. I often have it-- When I have a party--you know, after the oil fire has been out--people go to the door, they try the handle. Oh, guess what? It's locked and Trexel's already crawled through a vent and he's sealed that vent behind him, so we're stuck in here now. And I come back weeks later and they've become so cross they've just become skeletons.

#### DAVID

Oh... dear.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Clean-up crew urgently rerouted.

#### TREXEL

I don't know why people do it!

#### DAVID

Um... lack of food and/or oxygen.

#### TREXEL

Well that's just a state of mind.

#### DAVID

I-is it?

#### TREXEL

##### [slaps himself]

Yes, I've been oxygen deprived myself. I've never become a skeleton. Look! Look at my flesh. Look at my flesh!

#### DAVID

It's quite fleshy.

#### TREXEL

##### [clothes rustle]

Look at my nipples.

#### DAVID

##### [disgusted]

Oh, why? Put them away-- No, put them away!

#### TREXEL

##### [starts slapping nipples]

Oh!

#### DAVID

##### [firmly]

Put them away, Trexel. Plea-- Trexel!

#### TREXEL

##### [sing-songy]

Trexel's nipple dance.

#### DAVID

Put them away!

#### TREXEL

##### [puts shirt back down]

Okay. Okay. Friends don't make friends look at their nipples.

#### DAVID

Yes. That-- Thank you. 10 out of 10.

#### TREXEL

##### [David exhales loudly]

Thank you! Well, 3 out of 3.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Nipples!

#### DAVID

Okay-- Alright. Yes, I, I see what you've... done there.

#### TREXEL

So, but how-- how are you going to use me as a weapon?

#### DAVID

Well, as you said, maybe just engaging in light conversation.

#### TREXEL

Do you think that would be enough?

#### DAVID

I think it might be.

#### TREXEL

Should we run it?

#### DAVID

Roleplay?

#### TREXEL

Let's do a roleplay! Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

You are Ethel Unction Yeems.

#### DAVID

##### [posh voice]

Right. I am Ethel Unction Yeems.

#### TREXEL

Good afternoon Ethel.

#### DAVID

Hello. Oh, aren't you a horrible, dirty little man?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you, you stuck up tree branch! I'm gonna push you over and ruffle your hair!

#### DAVID

What? Eugh!

#### TREXEL

Look at this piece of paper! [__DAVID:__ Oh no.] I've not folded it in half, I folded it crosswise!

#### DAVID

Oh, goodness!

#### TREXEL

These sheets have never been washed! [__DAVID:__ I--] They've become oily with sweat!

#### DAVID

Oh, I don't like it. I'm going to have to leave!

#### TREXEL

You can't. Try the door, Ethel.

#### DAVID

I am. Oh no! The door is locked!

#### TREXEL

##### [paper rustles]

Wait, before you become a skeleton, [__DAVID:__ What?] sign this piece of paper and I'll let you out.

#### DAVID

No I shan't.

#### TREXEL

Oh! Oh, I've actually taken this duvet and I've turned it *half* inside-out then crumpled it up and put it in the bottom drawer!

#### DAVID

No! Not the bottom drawer!

#### TREXEL

My hands are filthy.

#### DAVID

You wouldn't dare!

#### TREXEL

Ethel, isn't it your turn to speak?

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Guess what, I've interrupted you!

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

I'm speaking out of turn, Ethel.

#### DAVID

How dare you! I am so very, very, very annoyed at *all* of this that is going on. Oh dear, I've had a heart attack and I've died.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

Oh, that's the-- Ah, too much then.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

I think too much.

#### TREXEL

That's the first step to becoming a skeleton.

#### DAVID

Mm. Yep.

#### TREXEL

And I should know.

#### DAVID

Wait, what?! Really?

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

##### [quietly]

Are you... are you a skeleton?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

How is that the conclusion you have reached?

#### TREXEL

David, do you-- do you think I'm a skeleton?

#### DAVID

I don't know.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Skin flaps detected. Clearly not a skeleton.

#### DAVID

Have you... have you been a skeleton? Are you an ex-skeleton?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Evaluating cost benefit of removing oxygen supply.

#### TREXEL

No.

#### DAVID

Are you sure?

#### TREXEL

Well, yes. I mean, sure, could I source flesh at short notice? Yes, I could. Could I put it on a skeleton? Yes, I could. Could I do that whilst I *was* a skeleton? That's harder to say, David.

#### DAVID

##### [quietly]

Right.

#### TREXEL

But if I did do it, would I remember? Because the brain is also flesh, so if I was a skeleton and didn't have a brain but then put flesh back on myself to make myself a person again, that would include a brain. So, would I know if I'd have done it? Is that how people are born?

#### DAVID

I don't know.

#### TREXEL

Do babies come from skeletons that place flesh on themselves?!?

#### DAVID

I was extruded out of a tube.

#### TREXEL

This is plausible then! I need to do some soul searching.

#### DAVID

Oh! You could do it while talking to IMOGEN and... no, okay, I see the look you're giving me.

#### TREXEL

If you try that one more time, David, I'm going to push my face *through* this table.

#### DAVID

That is a metal table.

#### TREXEL

Let me get there on my own. Stop clucking like a big, therapy-loving hen. Cluck cluck cluck. CBT.

#### DAVID

Oh, so you have done this before.

#### TREXEL

##### [becomes flustered]

No. What-- You-- Oh! Look over there! It's a wall!

#### DAVID

What? What, no, yes. Of course it's a wall.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Evaluation complete. More trouble than it's worth.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

So, Ethel Unction Yeems has become a skeleton because I've overdone it.

#### DAVID

Yes. So, I think we might need to just maybe meter it a little bit.

#### TREXEL

We need to-- we need to pick one threat.

#### DAVID

Pace it. Um...

#### TREXEL

Pick one threat, shall we. What's the biggest threat-- If you're a person who likes order, neatness, straight lines, what's the-- what's the one thing that's going to *really* just screw you right up?

#### DAVID

A game of gravity ball.

#### TREXEL

Expand on that.

#### DAVID

Well, you have the ball. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] No straight lines on a ball.

#### TREXEL

No, no. It's all just spheres.

#### DAVID

Yep. And, as well we know, the rules change every 3.5 seconds.

#### TREXEL

That's true. That's true.

#### DAVID

There are between 1 and 3,000 players.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Very unpredictable.

#### TREXEL

Very unpredictable.

#### DAVID

Lot of people in there.

#### TREXEL

Tricky to understand if-- even if people are playing or if they're just bystanders.

#### DAVID

Client room is cavernous but is it that cavernous? I don't think we want to find out [__TREXEL:__ No.] except we do in this situation. Um, also, covered in mud. Everybody's just covered in mud. Slipping about in mud.

#### TREXEL

You know what? I think we can do-- I can definitely get that room half filled with mud the moment we go in. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] We walk in, we deploy the mud. We chuck a ball in the middle and we say, "Ethel, it's time to play," and we just start playing. You can't avoid a game of gravity ball. If it's happening around you, you're a player. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] You either play or you die.

#### DAVID

Well, you don't even have to-- Wait. Ah, hang on a minute.

#### TREXEL

Oh, wait if they-- what if she refuses?

#### DAVID

And then dies.

#### TREXEL

And then dies.

#### DAVID

That's the problem.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Faux-gravity ball. You either play or it doesn't work, but we really hope that you play.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Because you think that if you don't you might die, which is in [and of] itself a bit of a threat.

#### DAVID

And if maybe we have faux-gravity ball, although it won't work, we can just threaten to keep doing it until she signs.

#### TREXEL

Yes. There's mud splatter with-- We're ruffling up our clothes. We're kicking in curves.

#### DAVID

Okay. Perfect.

#### TREXEL

I think you're there, David. It's time for you to get your diploma [__DAVID:__ Oh!] from the Trexel Geistman's Ten Steps to Sales Domination Plan.

##### [cheerful jingle]

#### DAVID

Yes! Okay. Right. Official Stellar Firma diploma. [incomprehensible]

#### TREXEL

Have you got your mortarboard?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Oh, in the drawer. Yep, here we go!

#### TREXEL

Have you got your gown?

#### DAVID

Uhhhh... Oh! I'll just use the bed sheets.

#### TREXEL

Have you got your special educational whistle?

#### DAVID

##### [blows whistle]

Uhhhm... Um...

#### TREXEL

Got all the things you confiscated from me and put in the hate drawer?

#### DAVID

I do.

#### TREXEL

Well, give them all to me. It's part of the ceremony.

#### DAVID

Is it?

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

It is.

#### DAVID

F-fine.

##### [opens drawer]

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

Here we go. Oh.

#### DAVID

##### [annoyed]

##### [closes drawer]

Just take the drawer. Just take the drawer.

#### TREXEL

##### [gives David diploma]

Yeah. It's all for Trexel. Okay. I present to you [__DAVID:__ Right.] your diploma.

#### DAVID

##### [takes diploma]

Okay! Thank-- This is-- Wait-- This is a--

#### TREXEL

You're welcome.

#### DAVID

##### [checks the back of the "diploma"]

This is a napkin.

#### TREXEL

I apologise, what?

#### DAVID

This is a napkin... from the Astral Bar.

#### TREXEL

Nope, that's--

#### DAVID

It has "Astral Bar" written on it.

#### TREXEL

I don't-- That's-- that's the--

#### DAVID

There is a Flaxen Whisk stain here.

#### TREXEL

That's a watermark. That's-- that's the people who print it.

#### DAVID

No, it-- it's been scrawled--

#### TREXEL

That's Astral Bar Printers.

#### DAVID

You-- This is in pencil. You've not even used a pen.

#### TREXEL

That-- that's-- that's calligraphy.

#### DAVID

Also, *my name* is misspelled.

#### TREXEL

What? Is it?

#### DAVID

*Your* *name* is misspelled. Trexel does not have a "y" in it!

#### TREXEL

Oh, no.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

This is... Is this it?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You cannot have been expecting more.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Y-yes. That-- that-- that's it.

#### DAVID

##### [upset and just barely keeping it together]

It has been three weeks. Three full weeks of *this*. And you knew this is what it ended in. You told me I would become a fully qualified salesperson with a diploma, which would have been *important*. Which may have kept me from being recycled for like *maybe* just a little bit! Maybe would have helped me in the long term. But no! I'm just here with a dirty napkin and broken dreams.

#### TREXEL

David. David, I'm gonna level with you because... from the start to now, we've obviously gone through a lot, and I don't think it would be fair if I was to lie to you.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

The sales course that you've completed--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--is not what you would call an accredited or official course.

#### DAVID

So, so this-- when you said it was Trexel Geistman's course you literally meant it's just--

#### TREXEL

It's absolutely mine.

#### DAVID

--just, just yours.

#### TREXEL

Completely designed by me. Not known or available to the wider Stellar Firma Ltd.

#### DAVID

So, Stellar Firma doesn't even know about this.

#### TREXEL

Not really. I think Hartro knows but I don't think she cares. So, it's not-- It's a good course, David. I think, I think you find it's a good course. You've learned a lot. You've grown. You know how to do the sell-- And, and, and you can really do sales now, I've seen you. You can do sales, but if you were to, to take it to anyone and show them they might, oh I don't know, laugh in your face and, and ask you to leave so...

#### DAVID

##### [emotionally drained from Trexel's shenanigans]

Fine, Trexel. Fine. I-I don't know--

#### TREXEL

But that's, that's okay, right?

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

I-I--

#### TREXEL

Faithful David always goes with the flow.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Faithful David has no choice.

#### DAVID

I honestly don't know... what I expected. And this basically just meets my expectations.

##### [loud knocks begin]

#### TREXEL

##### [oblivious]

##### [David sighs deeply]

Well, that's great to hear. So, how about we play a nice, fun game of gravity ball with Ethel! It's time to go.

#### DAVID

Let's go.

##### [large door opens]

#### TREXEL

##### [from meeting room]

##### [laughs as mud starts sloshing into the room]

It's sports o'clock, Ethel! Activate the mud flumes!

__[Ethel starts fearfully shouting, David sighs deeply, Trexel continues to__ __laugh]__
