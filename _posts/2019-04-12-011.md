#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [inhales loudly]

I knew this was going to happen. I knew it. It was always gonna go from late, to very late, to not turning up at all. I would happily just design the planet on my own but he gets so angry if I've looked at the brief beforehand but by the time he leaves it's past the deadline! Maybe I could tempt him into the office somehow. Maybe if I put some beef on his chair? Would that-- but I don't have access to beef. Maybe some sort of very strong cologne. I don't have access to very strong cologne. Maybe--

#### TREXEL [muffled]

Psst.

#### DAVID

What? What?

#### TREXEL [still muffled]

David.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

David.

#### DAVID

What-- Trexel where-- where-- What? The door didn't open. The light's not on. Where are you?

#### TREXEL

David, I'm in a vent.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

David. Is she still there, David?

#### DAVID

No-- What-- Hartro?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

No. No, she's been gone for the last... 52 hours.

#### TREXEL

Oh thank goodness. Let me get out of this vent.

#### DAVID

Have you been that vent--? Wait, hold on.

#### IMOGEN

Vent unsealed.

##### [mechanical whirring, David yelling, vent falling on the floor and David]

#### TREXEL

##### [normal]

David, I've been hiding. I ran away, David, and then I forgot why I ran away and I've been hiding for two days in the vents, so.

#### DAVID

In *the* vents or in *that* vent?

#### TREXEL

The vents are connected, David. I ran out and I got into *a* vent. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And then I started crawling around and then I got a little bit sleepy. Then I was asleep for a bit. And then I woke up and I couldn't remember why I was running away but I was running from something. Don't know what. But it's normally important. Normally I've angered someone. So I just thought "Well I'll keep on going." And then I got lost. And then it got really hot for a bit and some of the skin came off my hands, but not too much. I just went back a bit and then it was cold elsewhere. And then eventually I just heard you sort of whispering and chantering and I just crawled towards the ineptitude. And here I am!

#### DAVID

Well, umm. Thank you I suppose. But you're just here in the nick of time. It's almost the end of Monday and we have a planet to build.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful! No time lost then.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [bwoop]

Access granted.

#### TREXEL

Let's get the brief. Let's get the brief.

#### DAVID

Umm. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Let's get the brief.

#### DAVID

Right. There we go.

#### IMOGEN

##### [crosstalk]

Initiating.

#### DAVID [sighs]

This one is from Serafina Mouchet. [__TREXEL:__ Mmhmm.] They want a planet to show off money and aesthetic sense, of course. [__TREXEL:__ Of course.] But mostly as a place where absolutely no one will find me if I don't want them to. [__TREXEL:__ Ahh. I see.] They absolutely must have a labyrinth made of rivers, banks lined with densely packed mangrove trees.

#### TREXEL

Mangrove trees?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Interesting. Interesting. So a place that is-- Oh, oh David. I sense a duality. You know another duality. Why have one thing when you can have two and then point and then say "Look, a duality." So you've got two main elements here.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Look at me! And also, don't look at me!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So we need to cover both of those David. That's a challenge. That's a challenge.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You can't just make something shiny. People will look at it. You can't make something that's just, you know, unseeable. No one will look at it.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So, maybe we could have two planets circling each other. One planet so shiny you can see it. Look, there it is. Look, it's wonderful. The other planet-- well I can't see even-- is there a planet here? I detect the gravity but I don't know if I can actually see one. And then you've got two planets. And they'll be some sort of system that keeps them in line and you get from one to the other. It's not important. But the thing is you'll have two planets.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, I'm just wondering...

#### TREXEL

Okay. Wonder away.

#### DAVID

Because I'm looking at the company slogan. It's mentioning we're planet designers?

#### TREXEL

Sure, sure.

#### DAVID

We've made planets with moons and troughs and things but do we actually do two planets? Like-- Have there been any famous examples?* If* Hartro comes back to us and says "Oh, you got us to do more than one planet. The Build Team are very angry." Can we cite precedent?

#### TREXEL

Is there precedent? Is there precedent? Ah, could be. Could be. Could be. The tripod people. There are a race of tripod people. Three legs David! More than two. And they thought to themselves, "Well if most bipeds only have one planet and we've got three legs, then maybe we need to live on two planets simultaneously. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] They're a very stupid people, David. [__DAVID, hesitantly:__ Right.] But that's what they wanted. And we did charge them three times because, as I mentioned, they're very stupid. And so we said, "Well that's one planet. And then we build another planet. And then wear and tear and third planet subsidiary charge." And then we just didn't build the third planet and then there was two planets.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Precedent established.

#### DAVID

Okay, do we know anything about Serafina Mouchet? Are they particularly stupid?

#### TREXEL

No. Incredibly intelligent.

#### DAVID

Right, so that's--

#### TREXEL

They will see through that in an instant. [__DAVID:__ Right.] In which case they will probably organize some sort of militia army to come kill us all, so.

#### DAVID

So, *no* then.

#### TREXEL

Well you are right. That would therefore be a no, wouldn't it?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Precedent de-established.

#### DAVID

Yes. Well, but I mean, they wanted to show off money and aesthetic sense, of course.

#### TREXEL

Of course.

#### DAVID

But mostly as a place where absolutely no one will find me if I don't want them to.

#### TREXEL

And coming to think of it, two planets dancing in orbit would attract attention [__DAVID:__ Yes.] if one of them was quite low key. Okay, fine David. Okay, fine. Alright. You've got the poo-poo stick out and you're poo-pooing my ideas.

#### DAVID

__[crosstalk]__ No, I've just-- I'm just reading the brief. I'm just reading the brief.

#### TREXEL

__[crosstalk]__ Fine. No, fair enough David. How would you do it then, David? You got a planet. It needs to be seen and unseen.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel agrees]

Okay. So they specifically want rivers with densely packed mangroves, right? So that tells me that they like rain forests.

#### TREXEL

Vegetation.

#### DAVID

Well, specifically--

#### TREXEL

Fruit!

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel agrees]

--*specifically* mangroves. This kind of vegetation. So I'm thinking, you know, sort of dense forest, very verdant. But they want somewhere that can show off their aesthetic principles, right? So if we lean in to their aesthetic of mangroves and the rain forest and they want, you know, a network of rivers and things what if we designed an intricate maze-- a beautiful, intricate [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] geometrically perfect network of rivers along this planet.

#### TREXEL

The secrecy is the opulence.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

The sheer effort we have gone to, to disguise the whereabouts of an individual on this planet is *in and of itself* [__DAVID:__ Yes.] the demonstration of wealth and aesthetic prowess.

#### DAVID

And-- and they want to show off money, right?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

So we can do that by building the most expensive planet possible [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] so charging them a huge amount [__TREXEL:__ Huge amount!] so the only people with this amount of money can possibly pay for a planet.

#### TREXEL

##### [raises voice]

Exactly. People will look at that and think, "Wow, that is an expensive planet. These people must be pretty expensive. Let's go say hello. Where are they? I'm lost in a forest! I've *died*!"

#### DAVID

...Yeah, why not.

#### TREXEL

Yeah?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Price inflation detected. Consultants encouraged.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

The best thing about being hidden is people dying whilst trying to find you. I should know that. I've been in a vent system for a few days and let me tell you there's a couple of maintenance operatives that will not be going home to their wives and children.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Families informed.

#### DAVID

Did you kill them?

#### TREXEL

##### [David agrees]

Not important. Now what we need to do is find a way of getting this planet so intricately and densely but also beautifully and carefully designed that it will be both an opulence demonstrator and also a person concealer.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

That seems like it's gonna take a long time.

#### DAVID

Yes, and we do have roughly... let's say around about 13 minutes left.

#### TREXEL

Thereabouts.

#### DAVID

So, do you have any quick tips for developing a geometric thing?

#### TREXEL

Maths.

#### DAVID

Maths.

#### TREXEL

Maths.

#### DAVID

Maths.

#### TREXEL

You can find on IMOGEN, I'm sure, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] some sort of random number generator.

#### DAVID

Wait. Yes, there was-- I was looking in IMOGEN--

#### TREXEL

You were looking on IMOGEN again? You know how I feel about it when you do research on IMOGEN while I'm not in. It gives you ideas above your station, in that-- any ideas.

#### DAVID

Would you like me to give you one of those ideas?

#### TREXEL

##### [talking to himself]

##### [scoffs]

Ooh, let me think about it. Okay. It would be nice because it would help us and we need to do that though I'd be in trouble of course and you might die. Mm-eh that's not so much of a bad thing. But then also, I do hate it when you think. Okay, fine. Yes. Right.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Earth design history fact file.

#### DAVID

##### [uncertain]

##### [pronounced spear-o-grafe]

So, I was looking on IMOGEN some of the historical records [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] and I did find records of this thing they had a long time ago called a spirograph ?

#### TREXEL

Hmm, a spirograph?

#### DAVID

Yes. It's sort of like a plastic frame [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and you put a writing implement in it and kind of whirl it round and it makes all sorts of really, really intricate patterns.

#### TREXEL

Like a graph friend!

#### DAVID

Uhh, sure. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I had one as a child!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

Have a friendly graph friend [__DAVID:__ Friend.] because you don't have other friends [__DAVID:__ Friends. Oh.] Do do do. You've been locked in a room [__DAVID:__ Friend. Okay.] with some paper and a friend [__DAVID:__ Friend.] ooh ooh ooh. So if you've got paper and pen [__DAVID:__ Friend.] you need graph friend. [__DAVID:__ Friend. Friend.] You got it in the end. [__DAVID:__ Okay. Friend.] I had one. Yes, and they make wonderful, intricate shapes. But, you know, without any actual skill.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

Which is my ideal form of toy.

#### DAVID

So do you have one on you?

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I-- I might have my childhood graph friend in my satchel. Yes, hang on. Let me get it out.

##### [unzips satchel, rustling around, honk, squeak]

#### TREXEL

This is Percy and I want you to be very careful with Percy.

#### DAVID

I'm going to put Percy in the tube.

#### TREXEL [stammers]

I'm sorry, what now?

#### DAVID

Well, he needs to go to the Build Team.

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry, you're going to put Percy in a tube?!

#### DAVID

Well, the point is we--

#### TREXEL

Percy was all I had for years, David!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

At one point, I was put in a separate house to my parents. They said, "We can't have you under foot. And we have many houses. Go live in another one." I thought there would be staff, David. You'd think there would be staff. I was nine. There wasn't staff, David. There was just a big pile of meat and a fork and a note that says, "Prove yourself." And Percy got me through some tough times.

#### DAVID

##### [to himself]

I'm only three weeks old and I haven't had a pile of meat or a fork.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Sadness detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

##### [sarcastic]

Oh, oh, I see. Now I'm a Complaints Department. Oh, hang on, let me just put on my Complaints hat and put on my Complaints mustache and put down Percy the Complaints friend. [__DAVID:__ Mhmm?] What complaints do you have, David? You're warm. You're happy. [__DAVID:__ Yep.] You're looking-- I can see you reaching for Percy, David. Don't reach for Percy while I'm ranting.

#### DAVID

I'm-- I was just thinking really hard about the things I'm complaining about. One of them is that there are no pictures on the walls. Look, look up at the walls.

#### TREXEL

__[crosstalk]__ Right, I'm just going to look up at the walls. There are so many walls in here. It's so-- it's so bland. It's so blank. Maybe we should put something on the walls.

#### DAVID

##### [David quietly grabs Percy]

__[crosstalk]__ Look at all the walls. Look-- Yes, and see they are all very, very, very blank. And uh-- Yes.

#### TREXEL

I don't know. Maybe I can just scrawl on things. What were we talking about? Where am I? Who are you? Oh gosh, yes. So we need to find some sort of graph. Do you have a graph friend?

#### DAVID

Yes I do, actually.

#### TREXEL

Oh good, you have one on you.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Oh, what. That looks like mine!

#### DAVID

Oh, does it?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Oh, this one's called Henry.

#### TREXEL

Oh, Henry.

#### DAVID

Henry, yes.

#### TREXEL

I'll maybe introduce him to Percy one day.

#### DAVID

Alright, well, not today.

#### TREXEL

No. Okay.

#### DAVID

He needs-- well, he needs to go-- Henry needs to go on a holiday to the Build Team.

#### TREXEL

Henry's going on a holiday!

#### DAVID

So, the Build Team can use him to make our planet.

#### TREXEL

Bye-bye Henry.

#### DAVID

##### [cheery]

Bye, Henry!

#### TREXEL

Bye Henry.

#### DAVID

Okay. I'm just going to put it in the package. There we go.

#### TREXEL

Henry's my friend.

#### DAVID

Okay, no, Henry's *my* friend. Percy's your friend.

#### TREXEL

I'll say hello-- You know, I'm going to go home today and I'm going to say hello to Percy and it's going to make me sooo happy.

#### DAVID

Oh, that's good. You know Trexel, because I really want you to be happy because you really *deserve* it. [__TREXEL:__ Thank you.] Especially because of the way you *treat* me [__TREXEL:__ Thank you, David.] with such *respect*.

#### TREXEL

I'm so glad you recognize that, David.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastically]

Good. Well I'm recognizing that and I'm very happy that you're going to go *home* to your *nice house* and play with *Percy*. Anyway, what were we saying?

#### TREXEL

So, we've got a way of developing a nice [__DAVID:__ Yes.] complicated geometric pattern. [__DAVID:__ Right.] It will be very difficult to navigate from the ground. Now, we do need to avoid cheaters, David. We're going to get onto the opulence in a moment, but I've just had a thought. You're in a spaceship approaching a planet. [__DAVID:__ Yep.] A maze on the ground. You can see the middle. Why not fly to the middle? So how do we stop it from being just something, you know, like your standard workaday hedge maze where you can just plow your spaceship over the top?

#### DAVID

Well, first one: Henry. Second one: What if the maze had no middle?

#### TREXEL

No middle?

#### DAVID

Well it's a ball. If we're going to put it on a sphere, [__TREXEL:__ Right.] a sphere hasn't got a center, except for, well, the core. But on the surface, there's no middle because there's no end. So that means the maze has effectively infinite--

#### TREXEL

An infinite and endless maze.

#### DAVID

Yes. And-- and they want mangroves [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] so we can have mangroves that hang over so densely that you--

#### TREXEL

Ah, they cover-- they cover-- [__DAVID:__ Yes.] they cover the foliage. It covers.

#### DAVID

So, you can't see where they are. You might be able to see the maze. You have to be able to see the maze because otherwise you won't be able to see how opulent it is from space. *But*, if we have them covering so you can't see where Serafina Mouchet is, then... they can accurately hide.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

Yes, of course. And obviously, another tick in the opulence box, the mangrove, very ancient plant, David. [__DAVID:__ Right.] We have to synthesise every single one because it went extinct so quick.

#### DAVID

Right. Ok, so--

#### TREXEL

So that's going to-- Even in and of itself people are going to look at that plant and think "Wow. That's a lot of extinct plants. That money could probably have been better spent on, you know, humanitarian efforts or, you know, alien humanitarian efforts." What would the phrase be for that?

#### DAVID

A-lan-- Aliena-- I don't know.

#### TREXEL

That sounds racist.

#### DAVID

Clone-anitarian would be what I'd say.

#### TREXEL [interrupts]

I don't think we would have those. No, I'm going to say humanitarian and I'm going to get letters, David. I'm going to get letters but I'm going to stand by it.

#### DAVID

What, from the--

#### TREXEL

It's my right to ignore the basic phraseology for other species.

#### DAVID

Letters from the Build Team?

#### TREXEL

Yes. They get very cross about things like that.

#### DAVID

Oh right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Anyway. So, they're going to have the mangroves and that's going to demonstrate-- Okay. Well, that's-- that's the first level of opulence and it also takes care of the problem of people seeing you. So. Right. Now we need to get into the real meat of the matter, David, which is that this maze is made of rivers.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So, mangroves, if I remember correctly, grow directly out of the water. So, it's a base planet. It's a base planet. You just need a water ball, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Nice. Simple. We can overcharge for it massively because you don't write down just the water ball. You say "Oh, well, it's an aqueous job and that obviously causes wear and tear, we've got to have waterproof boots, you know-- all of the *mangroves* have to be waterproof." David, mangroves like being in the water but they don't know that. We just pretend it has to be a special mangrove. And you can add on loads of extra costs for that. So that's all good stuff. That's *really* good stuff.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

What are they going to navigate these rivers on?

#### DAVID

Gondolas.

#### TREXEL

Gondolas?

#### DAVID

Um, yes. Gondolas.

#### TREXEL

Are they going to have gondoliers on these gondolas? Or is there going to be gondoless gondoliers?

#### DAVID

Robondoliers.

#### TREXEL

Robondoliers? Ahh. "Come on my gondola. I don't need a gondolier. I have a robondolier."

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Will each robondolier be a distinct robondoleir? Perhaps a cast of characters? Ahh, see Roberto, the ex-baker. He once made the bread rise but now, he wakes with the rising sun and takes you on your way. Ah, look. It is poor Louis. He came here as a merchant laborer, but the Great Bread Famine came along. Roberto also got caught in that. And now he's had to become a robondolier. And you could just build a story. And obviously those stories will take writing and that writing staff will cost money. And we can charge huge amounts for it!

#### DAVID

Yes, and each cast member can have an incredibly lavish costume. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] They can have custom gondoliers so that when you--

#### TREXEL

##### [interrupts]

The gondoliers can be made of gold.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Gold-oliers.

#### DAVID

Goldoliers.

#### TREXEL

Robondoliers and goldoliers.

#### DAVID

Roboldoliers.

#### TREXEL

Roboldoliers? Whatever you called it.

#### DAVID

Golden robot gondoliers.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Golden robot gondoliers!

#### DAVID

Right. So, each of them are incredibly customised. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] They're completely made of gold. [__TREXEL:__ Exactly.] They will engage you in interesting conversation.

#### TREXEL

They'll research you before you get there. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] They'll look at how the traffic was [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and say "Ah, that looks tricky. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Perhaps you would like to buy some bread. I used to be a baker."

#### DAVID

Wait. Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

How?

#### TREXEL

How do you mean "how?"

#### DAVID

Well, how? How are they going to research? How are they going to know where you've come from? How are they going to have custom dialogue so they can specifically engage with each individual guest and their unique experience?

#### TREXEL

David. David, David, David. The answer is simple.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Computers.

#### DAVID

Computers?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right. What is a computer going to do here?

#### TREXEL

Compute.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Look things up. Check things. Work things out. Make it so.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um--

#### TREXEL

You've used a computer, haven't you?

#### DAVID

I-- IMOGEN, yes.

#### TREXEL

Do you know how it works?

#### DAVID

No, but I--

#### TREXEL

But you still used it.

#### DAVID

Well, yes.

#### TREXEL

And it still works.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

My point is made.

#### DAVID

No, but I've never actually had to--

#### TREXEL

No, I made the point.

#### DAVID

__[crosstalk]__ No, but we are-- Ok, we're not use-- no no. Yes. Yeah but-- No but-- Yes but we're not using the computers. We are designing the computers.

#### TREXEL

__[crosstalk]__ What is that? It's a point. I made that. I laid that point egg. Oww, I've just cut myself on this pointy thing I made.

#### DAVID

Yes, but, well, no. See, the problem is--

#### TREXEL

Okay. Go on.

#### DAVID

We haven't *made* the point. And we need to *make* the point if the point in this specific thing is a computer. We haven't *made* a computer, but we *need* to actually *make* a computer. So, if we were designing IMOGEN, we may have had to do more than say "IMOGEN looks things up."

#### TREXEL

Hmm. You make a very good point, David. You are also a point maker of sorts.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, in which case David, I'm going to direct you to IMOGEN. Put IMOGEN in every single one of the robots. Just copy everything. Put it in. Write that down. "Put IMOGEN in all of them."

#### DAVID

__[crosstalk]__ Okay. So, I'm just checking, is-- Yes. Yes. So-- Yeah. So, that's the question-- No, the question I'm going to be asking, can we-- should we do this?

#### TREXEL

__[crosstalk]__ IMOGEN is an enormous database of all the information of the company, just pop it right in. Pop it into each one. Pop it in.

#### TREXEL

I'm going to have a think. Yes. Pop it into every single robot. Then that robot is not only going to know [__DAVID:__ Yes.] where have you been? How is the weather? Because obviously IMOGEN has eyes everywhere. Just link it up. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] It'll also be able to offer points on the finer details of planet design. Everyone loves that.

#### DAVID

Right. So, we're going to have a planet--

#### TREXEL

Staffed by robots. Each one with the power of one of the most powerful computers in the known universe.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

That's opulent. That's going to be pricey.

#### DAVID

That is. Yes. That is opulent.

#### TREXEL

Whack it on.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

IMOGEN duplication process beginning. 47 million yottabytes remaining. Estimated time of download 256,512 years, 10 days, and 21 seconds. Would you like some music while you wait?

##### [Stellar Firma Ltd. theme begins playing]

#### DAVID

So, should I put it in as an optional extra? So we can offer it to the client?

#### TREXEL

Hmm. Call it a luxury design choice.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Yes, IMOGEN luxury design choice.

#### TREXEL

##### [quietly]

Exactly. Exactly. And no one can resist.

#### DAVID

No. We can also make it exorbitantly expensive.

#### TREXEL

Well, of course. All of this is going to be exooorbitantly expensive.

#### DAVID

Yes, but then what we can do is use that money to build a separate, dumber IMOGEN and then put that in all of the gondoliers.

##### [music turns off]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

IMOGEN duplication process ceased.

#### TREXEL

David, you sly horse.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I hear your deceitful hooves clopping down the alleyway of knowledge.

#### DAVID

Clippy-cloppy. Neigh.

#### TREXEL

Easy now. Get off my carpet.

#### DAVID

Okay. Yep. No.

#### TREXEL

Anything else in the brief that we haven't got to yet? Because we are pretty much running out of time.

#### DAVID

Right. Oh, yes. "Show off money and aesthetic sense." Of course. We've got that. Supposed to make a space where, where "absolutely no one will find me if I don't want them to." [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] You can have that. "Labyrinth made of rivers." That's basically the thing. "Banks lined with densely packed mangrove trees." Nope. Bish bash bosh, I think we've done it!

#### TREXEL

Okay, well that's wonderful. And you're pretty sure that Hartro's going to have no problems with this. Because I am. But obviously David, we have established thus far that when it comes to thinking... Trexel doesn't always have the best egg.

#### DAVID

##### [apprehensive]

...Yes, I think that Hartro will be happy with this one.

#### TREXEL

And you're committing to that, David. Because I will bring this up in the review. If, *if* she comes in here and she says "Why did you--"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Would you like to submit?

#### TREXEL

"--give every single one of these robots--"

#### IMOGEN [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

#### DAVID

Oh, it's gone now.

#### TREXEL

Oh, gosh. Oh, it's gone.

#### DAVID

Oh, it's gone.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's gone now.

#### DAVID

Yes. So.

#### TREXEL

David, you're becoming more reckless. I like it.

#### DAVID

What? No.

#### TREXEL

##### [David objects, tries to backtrack]

Just submitting a brief. Just submitting a brief when I'm still talking about it. David, you know, not too long ago, I would have been furious about that. I don't turn to you and say, "You faux-hearted pilchard. You barrel of hot axes. How dare you!?" Now I say, thank you. [__DAVID:__ Oh. Haha!] Thank you for taking the initiative, David.

#### DAVID

Yes. The initiative.

#### TREXEL

Like a kindly window taking out the hot air, letting in the cool.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Obviously we're on a space station, David. So, if you open a window, it will take out all of the air air and let in the killing vacuum. So, don't do that. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] But! The point stands.

#### DAVID

Right. Well. That's safe. And the breath of work has fallen out of the window.

#### TREXEL

David, are you trying to do metaphors again? What have I told you?

#### DAVID

And now--

#### TREXEL

Metaphors are for Trexel--

#### DAVID

--tomorrow--

#### TREXEL

--sitting quietly is for David.

#### DAVID

--we're going to work.

#### TREXEL

We're going to work, David.

#### DAVID

We're going to work on time.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

Okay. Bye!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Vent unsealed.

__[mechanical whirring]__

#### TREXEL

I'm going to crawl back into the vent, David, because--

#### DAVID

No, why are you--

#### TREXEL

--because I think it's very important that everyone see. I'm just crawling into the vent now, David.

##### [Trexel struggling while climbing into the vent]

#### DAVID

No. You could leave by the door. No.

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David, screw the vent back closed.

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel.

##### [whirling]

#### TREXEL

I'll see you tomorrow.

#### DAVID

Yeah, see you tomorrow Trexel. Bye.

##### [crawling in the vent noises]

##### [show theme starts]
