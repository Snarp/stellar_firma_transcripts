##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [fade into David screaming as he falls down a tube, followed by a splat and grunt from Trexel]

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel mumbles incoherently, asleep]

Oof--! Trexel! Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Take your hands out of the jar...

#### DAVID

Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Augh! [__DAVID:__ Trexel!]

#### TREXEL

##### [exclaims]

Augh! Augh! Who are you?! Get away from me! [__DAVID: [stutters]__ David!] Are these hands mine?!

#### DAVID

*Yes,* and David! What-- we're-- we're finally out of the tube.

#### TREXEL [relieved sigh]

How long were we in there for, David?

#### DAVID

Almost exactly 24 hours!

#### TREXEL

How do you know?

#### DAVID

Internal clone time.

#### TREXEL

Is that a thing?

#### DAVID

Yes! How'd you think I always knew when... twenty minutes... y'know, before the thing. The clocks-- all the clocks in there were broken.

#### TREXEL

I never questioned it, David! And why I never questioned it, I never questioned.

#### DAVID

##### [frustrated noise]

Wh-- fine, anyway. We're out the tube, and we are in... this... place.

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ Our new home, David. Our new home. Look at it! Drink it in, smell it! Mmm...

#### DAVID

It's not leaking!

#### TREXEL

No, no. David! This is *sales* now. [__DAVID:__ Right.] This is client-facing! We're in the big-time now, honey bear! [__DAVID:__ Okay?] This is where I cut my teeth! This is *my* patch! This is what clients might see, and therefore-- it's actually quite nice.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Official policy states that all of Stellar Firma Ltd. is very nice!

#### DAVID

Okay, um, so... what do we... *do...?*

#### TREXEL

What do we do?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

What *don't* we do, David? We are now... the first echelon of dream-weavers. We take the wants and needs of the galaxy and combine them, loomlike, into a sales pitch! And we take that pitch to the client. See over there, David?

#### DAVID

Uh huh.

#### TREXEL

You see that big, wooden door?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You see its big, impressive handles?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

That's the door... to a client meeting room.

#### DAVID

Wait, w--

#### TREXEL

##### [David stutters]

Don't look at it too much, David! [__DAVID:__ Okay, no, no, w--] Its glory is that that outshines the sun. And we -- you and I-- will take a pitch through there to meet an actual client, every single day [__DAVID:__ *Actually*--] and tell them... what we think their planets should be. And it is between us and them whether or not Stellar Firma gets that sweet, sweet business.

#### DAVID [uneasy]

So why are *we* doing that, then?

#### TREXEL

What d'you mean?

#### DAVID

Well...

#### TREXEL

We've been promoted, David! This is a-- reward!

#### DAVID

But we're talking to... people-persons!

#### TREXEL

Yes, people-persons! [__DAVID:__ In the flesh!] *Or* concepts, sometimes gas, don't be too prescriptive, David.

#### DAVID [aghast]

But this is entirely the problem! I've never met any people-persons!

#### TREXEL

##### [David mumbles nervously]

##### [blows in David's face]

Well, don't worry, David!  Don't worry! Calm down. Look, I'm gonna blow on your face. Wooooooo.

#### DAVID [sounds of disgust]

Augh-- stop it! Your breath is-- hot socks!

#### TREXEL

##### [in (dubious) French]

Isn't it calming?  *Pour femmes, pour hommes, pour...* David.

#### DAVID [whimpers]

Poor David...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

*Poor Imogen, qui fait tout le boulot.*

#### DAVID

Ooh... augh...

#### TREXEL

Now, don't worry, David. You've got a trainer for this!

#### DAVID

Right. Oh-- who are they?

#### TREXEL [

__crosstalk____]__ Somebody who's going to come in [__DAVID:__ Yes!] and give you all the hints and tips that it takes to be the most successful sales clone this organization has ever seen!

#### DAVID [relieved]

Ahh, sweet explanation! Who is it?

#### TREXEL

And their name...

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

...is Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID

##### [devolved into sound of low anguish]

Ahhhhh...

#### TREXEL

##### [inappropriately chipper jingle plays]

*Yes!* Congratulations, David, you've hit the jackpot!Or the *Trex*-pot, as I shall call it! It's me! It's me! That *I*, will teach that *you* can sales!

#### DAVID

Don't know why I expected anything else.

#### TREXEL

Now, there *is* a handbook!

#### DAVID

Oh, thank goodness.

#### TREXEL

I have lost it.

#### DAVID

*What...*

#### TREXEL

But I have memorized the parts that reconfirmed my preconceived biases! So, don't worry, David.

#### DAVID

So-- Trexel. Quick question... were you any *good* at sales?

##### [short pause]

#### TREXEL

I beg your pardon?

#### DAVID

Well, so you *were* a sales...person?

#### TREXEL

The *best* salesperson, yes.

#### DAVID

But then you were a design consultant.

#### TREXEL

Cruelly snatched away in my prime by internecine ramblings!

#### DAVID

...right, o-- okay, and it had nothing to do-- absolutely *nothing*-- to do with your performance as a salesperson?

#### TREXEL

##### [palpable silence]

I don't see how that'd be the case. Well, think about it, David, it's a logical... progression. I am... Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

Mm?

#### TREXEL

The most salesperson on all of Stellar Firma!

#### DAVID [flatly]

Right.

#### TREXEL

This is my life! This is what I was meant for from birth!

#### DAVID

Okay?

#### TREXEL

So how could it possibly be that I was removed for any reason other than skulduggery?

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, in which case, let's just... shall we just... try it out a bit? Maybe I'm-- I'm a client, and you're going to have to sell something to me.

#### TREXEL

##### [dramatic pause]

David, you sweet, innocent fool. *I'm* the client now.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Sell to me.

#### DAVID

But I--

#### TREXEL

You can't learn unless you're suddenly thrust into it. That's how people swim! You creep up behind them at night, and chuck them in a canal... and then you leave! And if they live, they were worth it. And if they weren't, well... nature finds a way.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Canal murder suspect list updated! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Is this another upsetting story about your parents?

##### [uncomfortable pause]

#### TREXEL [choked up]

No.

#### DAVID [inhales]

##### [jingles keys]

Oh-kay. Look over here! Look over here!

#### TREXEL

Oh-- aha! Jangles!

#### DAVID

And now you're the client!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

#### TREXEL

##### [grunts in concentration]

Okay, hang on a minute. I just need to get into the client mode. Now, David, I'm not an actor. But I feel like I *could*, 'cause I can do anything. Now, let me just-- okay, okay-- "I'm... big and stupid. And I don't know what I want and I want Trexel to tell me what I want. Oh good. Hello there. I am a client. I'm, let's say, a big blob, with weird pointy bits. And I want a planet. What are you going to do for me, mister clone?"

#### DAVID

Um... so... uh... Blob, may I call you Blob?

#### TREXEL

"Ah, I'm a big blob!"

#### DAVID

Okay, Big Blob!

#### TREXEL

"Yes."

#### DAVID

Yes, Big Blob. [__TREXEL:__ "Yes."] So, you're after a planet. Well, first of all, I have to say--

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

##### [bad impression of digestion sounds]

"I've absorbed you!" "I've absorbed your skin! And I'm digesting you inside me!"

#### DAVID [

##### [sobbing]

__crosstalk____]__ What did I do?! What did I do?!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [electronic powering off sound]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

#### TREXEL

Do you see what happened there?

#### DAVID

Um... I tried to talk to the client and then you absorbed me and ate my skin!

#### TREXEL

You tried to communicate with them as a *person*, David. You can't. A client isn't a person, a client is like... remember gazelles?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Remember spindly, often-eaten herbivores?

#### DAVID

Oh! Gazelles!

#### TREXEL

##### [David "mmhm"s]

That's the one. Now, imagine the client is like a gazelle trampling around a very well-simulated savannah. And *you* are like... a gun. Pointed at that gazelle, from out of the bushes. It's not fair, it's not right, the gazelle has *no idea* it's about to die, and that's exactly the dynamic you need between you and the client.

#### DAVID

So you want me to shoot the client with a gun?

##### [alarm blares]

#### IMOGEN

Alert! *Unapproved* threat to clients detected.

##### [guns unfold]

#### TREXEL

Woah, woah! No one's saying that! We... will not kill any clients! We-- we will not, uh, uh, we do not advocate killing clients, we do not advocate violence of *any* kind, in fact, we will stroke them nicely in the face with a feather.

#### DAVID

I will not shoot any clients unless the client wants to be shot--

#### TREXEL

No-- no-- no-- even in that-- well, I-- I don't know, David, don't introduce--

#### DAVID

If it's some sort of bullet-based lifeform!

#### TREXEL

Guh, it could be-- okay, well, unless it's that *specific* circumstance, we will not!

#### DAVID

Yes.

##### [alarm stops, gun retracts]

#### TREXEL [sighs]

Ah, there... David, this is a more... high-stakes situation than previously.

#### DAVID

*Higher stakes?*

#### TREXEL

Higher stakes! The clients are... like gods.

#### DAVID [confused stammering]

Wait, no, so-- so they're like gods--

#### TREXEL

What they say go.

#### DAVID

--but-- but we're not supposed to engage them as people?

#### TREXEL

No, Da-- you don't understand, this is very simple. Look, they're not people and you shouldn't respect them, but if at any point they decide that you've done a bad job, that's it. You are gone. They are the cash, they are the money, they are the *moolah*. And to Stellar Firma Ltd., moolah is all.

#### DAVID

Okay...

#### TREXEL

So you have to walk a fine line between ignoring everything they say so you can do what you wanted to do anyway, *manipulating* them, and also doing everything that they want and allowing their needs to be settled before your own... or you. Will. Die.

#### DAVID

*Riiiight!* Yes, I--

#### TREXEL

It's like a triangle of peril.

#### DAVID

I... *get* it. I *get* it! So you're interacting with somebody who on their whims your life and death depends, who is... kind of oblivious, and maybe a bit stupid, and doesn't know what they *really* want to do, and what you have to do is convince them that all of *your* good ideas are actually *their* good ideas.

#### TREXEL

It's very tricky, David, and I'm not sure that you're going to be able to do it, but it's worth a go.

#### DAVID

You know what? Think I might be okay.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, in which case, let's just try that again, shall we?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

"I'm a big guy. I'm a big ball. And as you learned previously, I will absorb you if given half a chance."

#### DAVID

Right. Hello, Big Blob. What would *you* like from a planet?

#### TREXEL

"I would like it to be a planet in which I can absorb people at an alarming rate."

#### DAVID

Oh-*kay*. So you need an absorption planet. Now, we at Stellar Firma can--

#### TREXEL

"Urgh! Oh, I've absorbed you! Oh, I've eaten and absorbed you! Nom nom nom nom nom."

#### DAVID

Now, hang on a minute!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [electronic powering off sound]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

#### TREXEL

I was hungry. I got bored of you and I was hungry.

#### DAVID

But-- but-- what--

#### TREXEL

You've got to entertain them, David. You've got to keep them l-- Look, also, don't get too bogged down in the details. We're not actually selling a real thing to these clients. We're selling an idea. We're selling a concept.

#### DAVID

Okay. Do we have any sort of conception of what the client wants beforehand?

#### TREXEL

Oh, yes! The bulk of the work, David, is us in this room before the meeting, [__DAVID:__ Right.] which will be at the end of the day, working out how we're going to sell this concept to the client. So, we'll get a brief. It's like before, David, we'll get a brief and that brief will just have really high level notes on what our client wants, you know, the core idea, maybe a couple of must-haves, you know, a couple of things about the client themselves, and we'll work up a little idea, sure, a little idea about what the planet might be but mostly what we need to do, David, is think about how we're going to sell the *idea* of having a planet to this client. All the rest of the details will be handled elsewhere!

#### DAVID

By the design team.

#### TREXEL

Yes. The design consultation teams.

#### DAVID [controlled frustration]

So, that brief that we, the sales team, get [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] sounds... desperately familiar. [__TREXEL:__ I don't know, David.] Sounds an awful like the brief we got as the *design* consultancy team.

#### TREXEL

No. David, David, David. The sales brief has quite a few more questions on it than the one we got.

#### DAVID

What-- Okay, so, so... so we have few-- lit-- mm, less information [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] than what the sales team started with. Can I make a guess, Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Do you have anything to do with that?

#### TREXEL [scoffs]

I couldn't say. I couldn't say.

#### DAVID

If I were, maybe, to talk to *another* design consultant--

#### TREXEL

I'd like to see you try!

#### DAVID

--how thick would the design brief be?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you know. Let's assume your regular gauge paper, er, you know, single spaced, double sided, about three inches.

#### DAVID

And we... got half a page.

#### TREXEL

About that, yes.

#### DAVID

Okay. And why was that?

#### TREXEL

It is possible that I used to get bigger documents and I started fires with them. Just I, after a while, all the paper around the office, and my constant smoking and camping, did cause a lot of fires so they said, "okay, Trexel, if you're not going to read them, we'll just send you the *most basic* version of this as possible and just try and do *anything* at all." In fact, if I remember the meeting rightly, it was "for the love of the Board, Trexel, just do something! Anything, Trexel! Just do anything! And you know what, Trexel? Maybe, maybe do something of *worth*! For once in your life!" Slam door! Walk down hallway! Go to bar! Drink for seven hours! Go home! Cry! I think that's how the meeting went.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

That's how most meetings go.

#### DAVID

Okay. So I think you might be right. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] We might be in a better place than we were.

#### TREXEL

It's a better place. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Look how much shinier the surfaces are, David.

#### DAVID

Wait, wait, wait. Is there a pod in here?

#### TREXEL

A what now?

#### DAVID

A pod.

#### TREXEL

A who now?

#### DAVID

A pod for me. A clone pod.

#### TREXEL

Oh!

#### DAVID

Beds, desks, things. Toilets, even!

#### TREXEL

Is there a clone-- 'cause there was one in the last room.

#### DAVID

That you didn't tell me about.

#### TREXEL

##### [tapping]

##### [tapping continues]

##### [tearing]

##### [clanging]

##### [sizzling]

##### [David yelps]

##### [pushes button, pod door swishes open, light clicks on]

Well, you didn't ask. So, let's just have a look.  Let me just-- I'm just going to tap bits of the wall. It's-- Okay, David, the problem with this kind of design is it's just smooth panels. There's no handles anywhere. It's tricky to find out what's a thing and what's not. And the only way to do it is to just RUN AROUND AND BATTER THINGS WITH YOUR HANDS. Ooh, that's a table. Ooh, that's-that's hot! Ooh, this is a David. Ooh, that's cold. Oh, ah, hang on, hang on, hang on. This is a clicky panel. Ah, there we go, David, there's a lovely pod for you.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

It's got a bed.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It's got a table.

#### DAVID [relieved]

Aah.

#### TREXEL

It's got a toilet for your end waste.

#### DAVID

Okay. I'm just going to go and-- Oooooooh--

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

David, get out of that bed! It's work time, David. And you know me, I love time for work.

#### DAVID [sarcastic]

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

That bed does look very soft though. I'm just going to have a little crawl in there.

#### DAVID

No, that's *my* bed!

##### [Trexel's relaxed groans]

#### DAVID

No, that's my bed! That is a clone bed for clones! You're not a clone!

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay, fine, fine, fine. The mo-- the moment at hand is the teaching moment. The teaching moment here between you and me having a moment to teach.

#### DAVID [frustrated]

Could you *teach* anything?

#### TREXEL

Okay, let's-- Okay, let's-let's swap roles.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You be the client [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and I'll be the universe's greatest genius, Trexel Geistman. Hang on, I just need-- I just need to-- I just need to get into character.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Oh, everybody loves you. You are... a genius. There it is. Okay, right. Now go.

#### DAVID [croaky voice]

"I am a sandpaper person and I want a planet."

#### TREXEL

What's that?

#### DAVID

"I am a sandpaper person and I want a planet."

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

##### [David groans]

I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over your own ineptitude. Hi. [__DAVID:__ What?] Take off sunglasses. Put cigarette out on leg. I'm Trexel Geistman. Stride towards client. Kiss on top of head. Tickle one arm. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Move away, sit down on chair with the back between my legs.  And I'm here to tell you that you want an ice giant world.

#### DAVID

"What?"

#### TREXEL

And scene.

#### DAVID

"What?"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

You see.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

You see, David.

#### DAVID

What just happened?

#### TREXEL

Exactly! What just happened? You were too confused to even be angry and that's where you get them.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

That's how it's done.

#### DAVID

Right. So, wh-what you're saying is we just decide on a world, stride into the room, tell the client that's what they're getting, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and walk out again.

#### TREXEL

Yes. And if it's got just enough in common with whatever they wanted, then when they walk out they'll be like, "hmm, is that what I wanted? I'm not too sure. I haven't got the self confidence because that guy in there his legs were *so* widely parted!"

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Um, so what's, um... what's my job then?

#### TREXEL

Your job?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You're my wing clone.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

My best bud.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

My partner in space crimes.

#### DAVID

So, I'm in the room?

#### TREXEL

You're in the room. You're with me. You're right in the trenches with me. Firing violently! Well, actually, aiming above everyone's head because really, in warfare, nobody really wants to kill anyone but we're just being made to BY THE POWERS THAT BE!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Borderline insubordination. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Right. Um, so, do I stub out the cigarette or--?

#### TREXEL

No, no, no. David, David, David. Have you heard of... good clone, bad consultant? Or, sometimes, bad clone, good consultant?

#### DAVID

I've heard of the first one. Haven't heard of the second.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sick burn detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

Well, it's very similar to the first one but the other way around. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] We need a little bit of light and shade between our approaches. If you just come in and shout at people and tell them they don't know what they want and keep on doing it, after a while, they get wise, David, and they're like, "You've got nothing! This anger and pomposity is a facade covering up the vacuum where your personality should be!" And that is a bad look, David. You need someone else to come in and say, "Hey, don't worry about them. I'm here and I'm actually quite nice. Would you like a cup of warm fluid? Perhaps a, a biscuit of some kind. I'll never tell you what it's made of.  It's made of my love."

#### DAVID

Okay, um, right. Well, should we try some of that out then?

#### TREXEL

Okay, so, now, this roleplay is difficult because there's three people involved [__DAVID:__ Yes.] and there's only two of us. So, for the purposes, the client is this cup of slurry.

##### [slurry pouring into a cup]

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, that makes sense because from your method, the client isn't actually going to say anything.

#### TREXEL

No. No.

#### DAVID

So, okay, right. Um, am I the good or the bad clone?

#### TREXEL

You'll be good clone.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [sniffs]

I'll be-- well, I don't like to say "bad Trexel" but, that's what I am. Okay. And--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated. Again.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Put down... your face. Pick up your life because thus far, YOU'RE WASTING IT, SIR! WASTING IT! I'VE NEVER LOVED YOU AND NEITHER HAS YOUR PARENTS!

#### DAVID

Now, would you like a moist towelette?

#### TREXEL

##### [David yells]

I'm gonna slap this towelette [__DAVID:__ What?] out of their hand! Don't look at him, look at me! I'm your daddy now! Eat my thumb!

#### DAVID

Right, so, your planet is going to be the most wonderful thing that Stellar Firma has ever created!

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel struggling to get the "client's" feet]

You don't deserve a planet! You barely deserve feet! Give me those feet!  Give me the feet!

#### DAVID

Now, I think, I think you deserve feet and a planet. No, two planets!

#### TREXEL

What's that? Six orders for ninety planets? Thank you very much. And scene.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

And scene. You see that, David. [__DAVID:__ Ooh!] You see how easy that was? Now, obviously in the real world, it's not going to be an inanimate cup of slurry that doesn't do anything and doesn't just agree with you. But!--

#### DAVID

Ah, ah, yes, I see, yes.

#### TREXEL

--it's pretty much that because what is a client than a cup of slurry?

#### DAVID

Um, chin-chin!

##### [cups clink, slurps slurry]

#### TREXEL

Aah! There you go. See? Not that hard.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [David groans]

Now, there is one final test to make sure that you're ready and we can just plow straight into client meeting after client meeting with wild abandon, David. We need to do bad clone, good Trexel.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

It's a much more difficult and nuanced one.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Gotta get the right balance of bad and nice, okay?

##### [David angrily grunting]

#### TREXEL

##### [slurry pouring into a cup]

Okay, right. Right, now, the clientis this cup of slurry. And... go.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Hello, dear--

#### DAVID [interrupts, angrily]

Listen to me, you abject piece of filth! You're going to buy a planet and you're going to like it!

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay, I'm very sorry--

#### DAVID

You! Quiet! You're not important at this point and nor are you, you stupid piece of filth on the underside of a Star Marlin's gullet!

#### TREXEL

Okay, end roleplay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

What?!

#### TREXEL

End roleplay. End roleplay.

#### DAVID

##### [grunts angrily]

What?!

#### TREXEL

David. David. David, come back to me. Okay, we might have tapped in onto a well of darkness I was not entirely sure was there. But it turns out it is and that's good, David. We can use that anger. How have I got to where I am today without a deep well of seething anger?

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### TREXEL

No where. So if you want to be like me, you've got to harness that anger, David. Don't-don't address the issues below it, David. That would be like tapping the well and capping its head. You've got to really *draw* on that well of anger until one day you're like me.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [David laughs nervously]

##### [cheerful jingle]

But thus far, David [__DAVID:__ Oh no.] that well, it's just too volatile and you're clearly not ready for prime time sales. Unfortunately, the end of today is the end of the training period and we are starting tomorrow.  But fear not; we can do both, David! We're gonna get the brief, work out what we're gonna do with the client before the end of the day and then go straight into a meeting, but in that time, in that time that we have together I'm going to take you through the Trexel Geistman Ten Steps To Ultimate Sales Domination Plan!

#### DAVID

Hooray.

#### TREXEL

So we'll do that, we'll work out what the planet will roughly be, and then we'll head in to see the client, and all will be well.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Caution--all may not be well.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, unrelated question.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I love an unrelated question! Do you ever think about what happens when--

#### DAVID [overlapping]

No, wh-- I, I, I had, *I* had an unrelated question.

#### TREXEL

Oh, sorry, I thought that had been just an open call for unrelated questions.

#### DAVID

No, no, how--

#### TREXEL

##### [interrupting]

Feet don't make sense.

#### DAVID

That's, That was a statement, not a question. Anyway, so, from here, [__TREXEL:__ Mhm.] how far away is the astral bar?

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, you know, now we're on the Sales floor, that's well up. That's well up and there is actually an executive bar quite close to here. That I'm not allowed in. So I will be at the Astral Bar, which is many, many levels down.

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### TREXEL

So it will take me a little while to get here.

#### DAVID

Oh good.

#### TREXEL

Which is tricky, because before the Cosmic Lounge was pretty close to our old office.

#### DAVID [deadpan]

Really?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

##### [awkward pause]

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So, you know, we'll see how that works out.

#### DAVID

Yeah, yeah, I guess we will. Anyway, there's a--

##### [alarm blares]

#### DAVID [panicking and stammering]

Oh! Uh-- um-- uh-- Lights! Red light, red flashing light, bad light! Bad light!

#### TREXEL

##### [overlapping]

Oh, don't worry, David, don't worry, David. That is the training light. And that flashes once in the entire life of a clone to let you know that training is over. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] In many ways it is a very expensive way just to have a light that just flashes once but it's the way it's done.

#### DAVID

Right, does that mean we're done?

#### TREXEL

Training's over, now you are a professional salesperson. Congratulations, do you wanna shake my hand?

#### DAVID

Uh--

#### TREXEL

I bet you do.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

But no,  it's not for you yet.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

The training light might have told you you're a professional salesperson, but I haven't. And I'm the real test. And when you reach the end of Trexel Geistman's Ten Steps To Sales Domination, then, *then* you will be a clone worth knowing!

#### DAVID

Yaaaay.

#### TREXEL

But until then--

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

You're just David. [__DAVID:__ Oh. Good!] David 7. [__DAVID:__ David!] Clone neophyte. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Microscopic talent. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Spot! On the windshield of the universe. [__DAVID:__ Alright.] Less than nothing. [__DAVID:__ W-- Now, hang on a minute, this is all getting--] Echoing through the vast emptiness of your skill is my voice shouting 'Hark! Hark and see my talent, welling forth and filling your mind!'

#### DAVID

Isn't it happy hour?

#### TREXEL

Oh my gosh, it is happy hour! I'll see you later, David!

#### DAVID

Goodbye!

##### [door swooshes open]

#### DAVID

Oh. Um, IMOGEN?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

#### DAVID

How would I theoretically deal with this unresolved well of darkness in me?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [error buzz]

##### [beep]

Assessing mind. Untangling physical and mental illnesses.  Error. Cannot be separated. Applying budgetary constraints.  Treatment recommendation: cognitive behavioral psychotherapy.

#### DAVID

Hm. Okay, um, seems, seems worth a go. Uh, can you, can you help me with this?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [beep]

Downloading therapy administration plugin. Hourly rate tripled.

##### [gentle, calming music starts playing]

#### IMOGEN

Let's begin.
