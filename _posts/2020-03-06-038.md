##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David! [__DAVID:__ Uh--] David, David, how are you?

#### DAVID [suspiciously]

Trexel! Um, yup, fine?

#### TREXEL

David, bring it in.

#### DAVID

What? Uh, oh. Oh.

#### TREXEL

David, bring it in.

##### [noises of clothing rustling, as if from a hug]

#### DAVID

Oh it's-- oh it's--

__TREXEL__: Oh, there it is.

#### DAVID

Oh, it's so warm...

#### TREXEL

*There* it is.

#### DAVID

Oh--

#### TREXEL

That-- that, David, that's a Geistman hug.

#### DAVID

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

Not many people get a Geistman hug! Mostly they get it because I'm secretly trying to strangle them, but I can't work out where their neck is. [__DAVID:__ Um--] Come here! [__DAVID:__ No, no--] That's not your neck, that's your torso!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hug strangler murder suspect list updated. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But that, David, that right there, that was a genuine Geistman hug.

#### DAVID

Okay?

#### TREXEL

How are you doing?

#### DAVID [suspicious]

I-- I doing fine. [*sic*]

#### TREXEL

How has your day been?

#### DAVID

Uhh, well, um, not much has happened so far--

#### TREXEL

No? Well perhaps I could get you some literature. Something to read?

#### DAVID

No, I've got-- I've got IMOGEN, there's-- that's fine--

#### TREXEL

Nothing you need, nothing you want there, David?

#### DAVID

Umm....

#### IMOGEN [beep]

This feels like: a trap!

#### DAVID

You to turn up earlier?

#### TREXEL [suddenly very intense]

We have fun here, David. [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] We have a lot of fun and that's a fun--

#### DAVID

##### [begins fake laughing]

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--and that's a funny thing to say. That's a funny thing to say, David, a funny thing, said by a funny clone, who is my fun friend. Ah.

#### DAVID [stops laughing and sighs]

Yes.

#### TREXEL

What should we do, David? [__DAVID:__ Um--] Should we just sit and talk?

#### DAVID

No, I think we should--

#### TREXEL

Should we sit and talk about our lives [__DAVID:__ No--] and our feelings? [__DAVID:__ --I think we sort--] I've always wanted to be a dancer.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, look-- Oh! Here's the brief! Here's the brief that we have to do for a client meeting in twenty minutes' time. As nice as this is, we do have work to do.

#### TREXEL

You're right, David. You're right. I accept that.

#### DAVID

Good. Good.

#### TREXEL

I went walking with Lucy yesterday. [__DAVID:__ Right.] After the session, we, we walked along the promenade, gazing out of the viewports. People look, they judge, sure, but we didn't care.

#### DAVID

I noticed you're still holding, um, her.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right, well, just, keep, keep up the good work.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Um, so, the, the brief is from Yinly Strong. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Um, pronouns are she/her. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Uh, she wants a planet built to "work out and build up some rad muscles for a bodybuilding competition."

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Ooh, I like a rad muscle.

#### DAVID

She also--

#### TREXEL

Bicep! Tricep!

#### DAVID

Yeah-- she-- uh, she also--

#### TREXEL

Dicep.

#### DAVID

She also--

#### TREXEL

Rad muscles all.

#### DAVID

Right. Um, q-quadricep is also...

#### TREXEL

That's a good one, David! Well done.

#### DAVID

She also wants this planet to function as a bee sanctuary, as honey is the only sugar that she can process.

#### TREXEL

Ah. Some sort of very specific type of diabetes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Not how that works.

#### DAVID

I can only assume so. Or some sort of rad bodybuilding technique.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

Could be! Could be! Maybe your muscles are so big only the sweet, sweet honey of the bee can supplement your growth.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel starts laughing loudly like it's the funniest thing he's heard but the laughing's a little too much]

Yes, maybe she is body bee-uilding!  Oh... a ha... oh...

#### TREXEL

Excellent, David! Excellent stuff!

#### DAVID

Was it?

#### TREXEL

Excellent stuff!

#### DAVID

Okay. Not--

#### TREXEL

I like that. And I like you.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Somehow worse than hostility.

#### DAVID

Um, so, her likes and dislikes. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] Um, she likes working out, getting ripped, and flexing.

#### TREXEL

You could say they're swole.

#### DAVID

I-- I believe she's swole.

#### TREXEL

Does she have "sick gains"?

#### DAVID

Um, I believe that her objective is to receive gains that, um, that one could describe as sick, yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay, this is good to know.

#### DAVID

She dislikes *noodle arms*--

#### TREXEL

Mm-kay.

#### DAVID

--um, and anything that has to do with feet because she has no feet and she is a no-foot supremacist.

#### TREXEL

Ah! She neglects leg day.

#### DAVID

Uh, well, she neglects foot day. Nothing here about legs.

#### TREXEL

It's ha-- it's hard to do squats without feet. You just overbalance! You're just on nubbins.

#### DAVID

Well, maybe she has a large--

#### TREXEL

She focuses on arms too much is what I'm saying.

#### DAVID

Well, we don't know that. She may--

#### TREXEL

Look, you've got great biceps but where's your endurance? What if there's a fire you need to escape?

#### DAVID

We don't know her method of perambulation.

#### TREXEL

She could roll.

#### DAVID

Or have, like, one big leg with sort of a pad.

#### TREXEL

Maybe a wheel.

#### DAVID

Maybe a wheel.

#### TREXEL

Is there a wheeled creature in nature?

#### DAVID

I don't know, you're the one who gets to go outside.

#### TREXEL

You'd have to create such a strange joint. You could engineer something like that with some sort of spherical omni-joint right in their thorax and then you graft a wheel around it. But what if you needed to change the tire? How would you do that?

#### DAVID

Yeah, maybe--

#### TREXEL

That would be quite the project.

#### DAVID

Maybe some sort of weird animal with like, this one big claw that they sort of hobble around and then you attach sort of this nut or a berry to it. And it oils itself up and you roll around, and it's all very str--

#### TREXEL

You sound like an idiot!

#### DAVID

Oh.

#### TREXEL

You sound like an increasingly tedious idiot.

#### DAVID

Ah, well, we dealt with the tedious idiot last time. That was Paxt Scrum.

#### TREXEL

Paxt Scrum will not enter our conversations again, David!

#### DAVID

No. No!

#### TREXEL

We can't go through that again!

#### DAVID

No, no. And I'm not going back, you're not going back, neither of us are going back!

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

*We're not going back!*

#### DAVID

No, we're dealing with Yinly Strong, the no-foot supremacist.

#### TREXEL

With a big wheel, okay.

#### DAVID

She also doesn't like dinosaurs.

#### TREXEL

Well, who does?

#### DAVID

I quite like din-- they're quite--

#### TREXEL

Why?!

#### DAVID

But they're kind of fun.

#### TREXEL

They're nature's failures.

#### DAVID

So?

#### TREXEL

Who likes a failure?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Dyson, that's who.

#### DAVID

I quite, you know, have a certain amount of sympathy for an underdog.

#### TREXEL

What, with your-- You're gonna support an underdog? But they're underthings! You can barely see them. "Where's the underdog?" "Oh, I think it's under a cushion." "Well, I've already sat on it and it's died."

#### DAVID

Well, some of them were quite big.

#### TREXEL

What, like a big underdog?

#### DAVID

Yeah, like a--

#### TREXEL

That's an overdog, David. You're describing an overdog.

#### DAVID

Well, no, but a big dinosaur-- You said all dinosaurs are underdogs. What about a big dinosaur?

#### TREXEL

Look, unless a T. rex comes here and does a T-flex, I'm not gonna respect it.

#### DAVID

Right, well, speaking of T-flexes, let's move on with Yinly Strong. Um, if she were an animal, what would she be? A gazelle.

#### TREXEL

That's a very leggy and hoofy animal.

#### DAVID

But not a--

#### TREXEL

Footy animal! Perhaps-- actually, perhaps it's not that there's a complete absence of any end to the leg, it's that she's a hoofer and not a footer.

#### DAVID

Possibly. We don't know.

#### TREXEL

We don't know. But we'll learn together, David. Hold my hand.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Through the rest of this conversation--

#### DAVID

No, I'm not-- no, I'm not going to--

#### TREXEL

--hold my hand. I'm reaching my hand out in friendship to you, David.

#### DAVID

No, just-- I-I need to hold-- I need to hold the brief.

#### TREXEL

Hold my hand.

#### DAVID

Ok-- Fine.

##### [disgusting squelch as they hold hands]

#### TREXEL

##### [David exhales]

##### [sticky noise as they let go]

There it is.  That's a bit sweaty. Let's just let go. That was a nice thought, David, but it's a bit sweaty so...

#### DAVID

Well... you know. Um, what is her greatest strength? Her big old muscles.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

Well, of course!

#### DAVID

What is her greatest weakness? She has none.

#### TREXEL

Oh, that's a bit much.

#### DAVID

Mm, I'd beg to differ... Yinly Strong.

#### TREXEL

No weakness? Yinly Strong, no weakness?

#### DAVID

I th-- I think the muscley lady doth protest *too* much!

#### TREXEL

You can't flex your way out of this one, Yinly.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

So David, this brings me to lesson nine of the Trexel Geistman Ten Steps to Sales Domination!

##### [cheerful jingle]

#### DAVID

We're almost there.

#### TREXEL

It's a fun one.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Schmoozing.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Or, as it's better known--

#### DAVID

Emotional abuse.

#### TREXEL

No, no, no. As it's better known--

#### DAVID

Crying.

#### TREXEL

No, no David, it's--

#### DAVID

Beating the sticks.

#### TREXEL

No-- Although that-- No, no, that's not it, David. No, it's... client entertainment.

#### DAVID

Right. Oh, okay.

#### TREXEL

Taking them out. Making them feel good about themselves.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Making them your friend. And, between you and me, David... bribery.

#### DAVID

Okay! I s--

#### TREXEL

But a nice bribery. We're not, we're not trying to find out something secret and blackmail them with it. We're not trying to use this against them. It's just good, old-fashioned palm greasing. You've got such a greasy palm, you try and shake someone's hand, it just slips away. Oh, you've poked each other in the chest. That's a bit embarrassing. But everybody's got more money than they had before so everyone's happy.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You see?

#### DAVID

As somebody who is basically permanently greasy, I don't really understand.

#### TREXEL

You'll get it straight away. You'll-- you're a natural palm greaser. Okay, imagine this. A client has come to you.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And they're saying, "I think I'm gonna spend a lot of money on a big old planet for you." In this particular instance, it's a planet to work out on and build up some rad muscles for a bodybuilding competition. This person is intensely rich. Maybe they've made all their money *from* bodybuilding. Maybe they made their money elsewhere and then found a hollowness inside that they had to fill with bodybuilding. Whatever the reason, David, they're pretty swole and they want you to know about it.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You're gonna have to get on their good side, because they could go anywhere, David. I mean, obviously they couldn't go anywhere because Stellar Firma is the only company in the known universe that has our kind of terraforming technology.

#### DAVID

It's our USP.

#### TREXEL

##### [sound of large and threatening gun unfolding, low tone beeping]

But they might decide that perhaps this is a bad way to spend money.  Which I am not, I am not endorsing as a view.

#### DAVID

No. No.

#### TREXEL

The spending of more money on, on large planets that often explode is, is a perfectly--

#### DAVID

Very good. Very good use.

#### TREXEL

##### [beeping stops, gun disassembles and retracts]

--reasonable way to spend your money.  Yes, okay. [__DAVID:__ Right.] So, to make sure that you really close the deal, we need to show 'em a good time.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Take them out on the town. Stellar Firma has a leisure deck or two.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You are banned from the leisure deck.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Maybe we'll go to the casino. Gamble our credits. Oh, blow on your dice? I will.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Also from the casino.

#### DAVID

Yeah, okay, that, that's all fine, um, except that I cannot go to any of those places.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

That's a good point. That's a good point, David. How are you supposed to properly schmooze a client--  You can bribe them, sure. I could just give you a wad of, a wad of credits to, to give to them but that's, that's not art, that's just sort of a brute force approach.

#### DAVID

It's a bit crass, yeah.

#### TREXEL

It's-- it's a bit crass! And I'm not crass!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You are beyond crass.

#### TREXEL

But how are you supposed to take them out and show them a good time when you can't really leave the premises.

#### DAVID

Well, the client room is quite big and echoing. What if we brought the good time *in*?

#### TREXEL

We could bring the good times to them. A portable casino just for you. Yinly, Yinly, going to a place where things already are, that's boring. That's a thing of the past. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] That doesn't use your big, strong arms. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] So why don't you reach over here and drag this big box, 'cause guess what's inside, Yinly.

#### DAVID

A present!

#### TREXEL

A present. But what is the present?

#### DAVID

Uh, a gazelle!

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

No, no David, it's not a gazelle. That would be sheer bribery. You know what, there could be a gazelle in a box. Let's have that in the back pocket because, at one point, I might just want to give them a gazelle. But no, what's in the box, a fold-out, portable, pop-up casino. Press a button,  *kaboom*! There's a casino there! [__DAVID:__ Eugh.] There's croupiers! There's dancing people! There's a big wheel that you spin and if you get the number right everybody cheers and says, "Yay!"

#### DAVID

##### [sucks air between his teeth]

Okay. Okay. Right. So, so that's great. Um, we kind of just have to mobilise that sort of work force in the next...  8 or so minutes so--

#### TREXEL

That's gonna be completely impossible, David. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] So what we need to do is employ a previous lesson: lying.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

We're gonna tell them that's what's gonna happen, get them really excited, and then say, "Oh, you just have to sign on the dotted line there," and then once they've done that, kabam! The veil of tears.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Do you know what the "veil of tears" is?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

It's a Geistman move.

#### DAVID

Well, from the "kabam" I assumed you just fired them into space again.

#### TREXEL

No, no, no, because then they can't be a customer. The "kabam" is a metaphorical kabam.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I promised you things. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I said we were gonna do some fun things. You signed on the dotted line. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] I turn around, walk out the room and you're like, "Woah, woah, wait wait. Wait, didn't you-- didn't you promise this? Didn't you promise that?" And I turn around and say, "Well, you should have read the fine print," and then I put on sunglasses inside and walk out.

#### DAVID

Ugh.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Berk detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

I feel a bit bad now.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

Is that a bit mean?

#### TREXEL

Is it, is it-- that is a bit mean. And, if I'm honest David, I-- I've been feeling a bit worse when I've been mean. [__DAVID:__ Really?] And I don't know what that is! Maybe I'm ill. Am I dying?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

In a way, yes.

#### DAVID

Maybe you should just, just stick with that for a bit. Maybe think about it for a bit. Just live with it and see how you-- see how, see how it feels.

#### TREXEL

I feel bad when I do bad things.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

What could that mean?

#### DAVID

What could that mean?

#### TREXEL

##### [talking through his thought process]

Okay, I'm feeling bad... I've done a bad thing. [__DAVID:__ Have you-- have you--] Which has made me feel bad. I'm really struggling with this.

#### DAVID

Have you done a good thing?

#### TREXEL

I occasionally do a good thing.

#### DAVID

How does that make you feel?

#### TREXEL

Well, you know, kind of, um, sort of like, uh, like I've been hugged but inside my feelings.

#### DAVID

And you would call that feeling-- if you were to give that feeling sort of a, a value...

#### TREXEL

It would be a, a valuable feeling that I, I liked. [__DAVID:__ 'Kay.] I'd give it, I'd give it a 10.

#### DAVID

Ok-- A 10 out of?

#### TREXEL

I'd say 10.

#### DAVID

Okay, 10 out of 10 like--

#### TREXEL

I really like feeling that way.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And that bad feeling's a-- it's a 1 or a 2.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Maybe a 3 if I'm being vindictive.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, what about you do the things that make you a 10 more than you do the things that you make a 3?

#### TREXEL

In a selfish bid to feel good all the time just for myself?

#### DAVID

I mean, it's a start.

#### TREXEL

I could do that. I'll selfishly feel good by being nice. Ha ha! Gotcha you, you idiot!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Moral egotism detected. Metaphysics seminar scheduled.

#### DAVID

Okay. Th-that works. Just keep doing 10s.

#### TREXEL

10s for Trexel!

#### DAVID

10s for Trexel. Trexel feels 10 like he likes the thing that is a 10.

#### TREXEL

Hey, you're doing a good job.

#### DAVID

Thank you.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Gotcha.

#### DAVID

##### [playing along]

##### [Trexel chuckles]

Ooooh, I've been rused!  You rascal!

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

I'm a rascally fool! I'm like a raccoon except I've not eaten your garbage.  Although... got any garbage?

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel smacks his lips]

##### [bin clanks]

Um...  I mean I-- I suppose I-- I do have this bin  that's been here for the last--

#### TREXEL

Could I-- could I just rootle around in that? Would that be okay?

#### DAVID

I mean, if you, if-- if you want?

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

I kind of do.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, there you go.

#### TREXEL

##### [papers rustling]

##### [pulls out paper]

Okay. What have we got in here? We've got a lot of leftover glitter glue from Lucy. We've got straps of paper with--  Is this poetry?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

What's this poe--

"I wander lonely as a clone.

All on my lonesome, lonesome own.

I have no one to see or speak with.

I had a glove. I like to eat it."

This is terrible, David!

#### DAVID

Well, it's a work-in-progress! That's why it's in the bin! I don't keep my best poetry in the bin!

#### TREXEL

"I look out of the starport at the darkness outside,

but there is a feeling, a feeling inside."

That's a bit of a weak rhyme, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, you know--

#### TREXEL

"But there's one person, the only one I've ever known.

Trexel, a friend of a clone."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes.

#### TREXEL

Well, it's bad poetry, David, but it's, it's quite sweet.

#### DAVID

Yeah, well, quite frankly I've moved on from rhyming couplets and I'm doing more of, sort of a, a freestyle beat thing.

#### TREXEL

Oh, have you got some of that? I'd love to hear it, David.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

No. No. I don't. I don't-- No, I don't have any. I don't--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

##### [lays down a beat including snapping and scat singing]

No no. No, David, let's do it. Come on.

#### DAVID

Darkness.

My feelings

they're hurt now.

I'm thinking

I don't know what!

I don't know where!

Where is my place

in this crazy mixed up station?

Is it with Trexel?

Is it with IMOGEN?

Who are the Board?

Who is Hartro?

There are her feet.

Why are her feet?

Keep your feet

to yourself.

Leave me alone!

Ah-- no, I'm done. No, I can't go there.

#### TREXEL [snaps fingers]

I'm applauding. I'm doing jazz applause, David.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right, well... thank-- thank you, I suppose.

#### TREXEL

Keep working on that. That's some solid stuff.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Further beat poetry will be met with violent reprisals.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You know what? I know you're not allowed out but the Astral Bar, as much as I hate to admit it, they have a pretty good jazz night.

#### DAVID

Well, I can't go to that.

#### TREXEL

But I could record you and I could... play it over the speakers there. And I could record the crowd's reaction and bring it to you. In a small way, that could... give you some sort of connection to the outside world.

#### DAVID

Okay, that's actually very... thoughtful.

#### TREXEL

That's a 10 for Trexel! Num num num num num. Num num num num num. Mmm!

#### DAVID

That's a 10 for Trexel. The system works. That's... actually very nice. Thank you.

#### TREXEL

It's okay.

#### DAVID

Um... but we do have to deal with Yinly Strong.

#### TREXEL

Who?

#### DAVID

Yinly Stro-- the client.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

##### [grows pensive]

Oh! My Board! I actually, genuinely forgotten about them. This, this new rush of trying to do nice things, even though it's in a selfish way, it's--  it's, it's bedazzled my sales brain.  I almost feel like maybe it...

#### DAVID

Kabam! Kabam!

#### TREXEL

Maybe it's affecting my sales brain.

#### DAVID

Kabam!

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

Do a kabam!

#### TREXEL

A kabam? What, what kind of kabam?

#### DAVID

No, the kabam. You said "the kabam". "The veil of tears."

#### TREXEL

I-I don't know if I can. That would make me feel a 3 or maybe even a 1.

#### DAVID

Okay, in which case, how 'bout *you* take Yinly out for a nice evening.

#### TREXEL

Yes, I suppose I could. But-- but then how do I, how do I leverage that into, into a sales situation, David, if I--

#### DAVID

Well, no, keep do-- No. No, no.

#### TREXEL

--if I've lost the power to be a horrible, horrible ass--

#### DAVID

No, no, this is fine!

#### TREXEL

--then maybe I can't do sales anymore!

#### DAVID

No no. What i-- No. No, it's fine. What if you got them to sign on the dotted line, right?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

And instead of "veils of tears"-ing them, you invited them to a "veil of fun"?

#### TREXEL

A veil of fun?

#### DAVID

##### [whispers]

Kabam!  *Veil of fun*.

#### TREXEL

Oh, kabam! Here's an ice cream. Kabam! It's a card signed by your loved ones.

#### DAVID

Kabam! Come to the Astral Bar with me. They have a very good jazz night.

#### TREXEL

Kabam! I've got David's beat poetry. It's not going down that well, but people don't want to look like they don't get it, so they're applauding anyway.

#### DAVID

Kabam! Let's maybe wait for it to actually happen before we start judging it before it's been recorded.

#### TREXEL

Kabam! I've seen a fair bit of beat poetry so far and it's never gone down well.

#### DAVID

Kabam! Well, maybe this will be different! Maybe I'll be a hidden talent.

#### TREXEL

It's possible, David, and I'm not going to prejudge.

#### DAVID

Thank you.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

*10 for Trexel*.

#### DAVID

System's still working. Anyway, right. So, what is the plan for Yinly?

#### TREXEL

Okay. The key here is we're going to go in there, we're going to be nice, we're going to be kind, we're going to promise a lot of schmoozing, and I am afterwards going to deliver on that.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I'm going to take them to a casino. I'm going to take them to a bar. Maybe we'll listen to some of your beat poetry.

#### DAVID

Well, I haven't recorded any yet, so probably not now? I mean, it takes a while. I really need to get into the--

#### TREXEL

Okay, David! We'll do something else supportive to you and your endeavors. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] But the point is we will deliver on that, and through that method we will get them to sign on the dotted line.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But the thing is, David, there is one key thing we have forgotten. They dislike noodle arms. Now, Trexel... Trexel's hench. Trexel has no complaints in the swole arms department.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

By what possible metric?

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

But David, you're very, you're very noodley. You're very specifically noodley. Clones are designed that way. You've got soft bones so you don't break as easily when we, you know, chuck you down things. So, you need to just *really* hide all of your--how do I put this?--body.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Stand behind me at all times [__DAVID:__ Well--] and just pop your head out.

#### DAVID

##### [fabric rustles as David pulls his arms in]

Wait, no, tell you what. Say what, I'll just, I'll just take-- get my onesie and just pull the arm in and then--

#### TREXEL

Ooh, yep.

#### DAVID

--just pull the other arm in and then here I go!

#### TREXEL

##### [struggling]

##### [loud knocks begin]

Oh, you know what? They don't, they don't like feet. So, why don't we both take our legs[__DAVID:__ Okay.]  out of the onesie holes, [__DAVID:__ Yep.] just tie those up, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.]  and we're just gonna sort of wobble in like some weird, unlockdownable egg.

#### DAVID

Yeah, okay. Right. Sure.

#### TREXEL

##### [struggling]

Okay. Alright. Are you ready? Are you ready, David?

#### DAVID

##### [grunts]

Yep.  Yep. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Okay, it's a bit hard to move but I, I think we can manage this, David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I think we can manage this.

#### DAVID

Okay. And we'll hop!

#### TREXEL

##### [large door opens, sounds of Yinly working out] [From meeting room]

##### [struggling to move into the room]

Ready? Okay!  Give us a minute, Yinly.  Ah, David, just fall forward and drag with your arms.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [grunts]

We're coming, Yinly! Don't you worry!

##### [David grunting as he moves across the floor]
