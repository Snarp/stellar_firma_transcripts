##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [sighs]

##### [sigh]

I just... I just wish he'd be here. Just, not even on time, just-- just soon. So I can get on with it. I mean, he knows when I've looked at the brief. If I can just get him out of this room quickly, then I can get to work myself and actually make a *good* planet...

#### TREXEL

Ah! [__DAVID:__ Oh! Trexel.] David. David, David, David, David, David, like a rising sun you emerge as the door opens, and I say "yes", a flower turning towards my clone David. How are you?

#### DAVID

Uh... fine. Yes. Should we - shall we get on? Should we crack open the brief?

#### TREXEL

Don't you want to know how I am, David?

#### DAVID

Uh-- how are you, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I'm more than fine, David, I am exuberant.

#### DAVID

Oh, that's really good!

#### TREXEL

We are a unit. We are a team and we are gelling, David, more than ever before. We are gelling. I think we're doing our best work, David. The last few planets that we have done, I-- I don't know, there's something-- there's something special about them, David! There's something-- there's something different about them! It's as if you're more-- more open, and more susceptible, and just saying "yes" to the things that I say. I'm just speaking out loud now, but I-- I don't know what it is, but it-- it makes me happy, David.

#### DAVID [dryly]

Yeah, you know what? I agree. I think the Build Team are currently receiving the best work.

#### TREXEL

Exactly, exactly. It's like you're speaking my innermost thoughts as if you plugged a cable into the side of my head while I was asleep and sucked them out with a straw.

#### DAVID

Well... I didn't.

#### TREXEL [laughs]

I'm glad you didn't, because if you had I... would... hit you.

#### DAVID

Okay! Cool. Well, shall we get on with the brief?

#### TREXEL

Well, let's!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Here we go.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

So, this is from Henkka. Why do they want the planet built? Well, they are sick to death of high gravity. They want to live somewhere where their joints don't hurt just from standing up.

#### TREXEL

Well, understandable!

#### DAVID

Yes, and one non-negotiable feature is that there is no winter on this planet.

#### TREXEL

No winter? No winter. No winter. Well, this-- this, David, this is a-- this is an interesting brief, because it-- it-- it strikes the very heart of what it means to be alive. You're alive, aren't you, David, in a way? In a way, aren't you alive?

#### DAVID

Yes, I am definitely alive.

#### TREXEL

I domean, in a sort of a way alive?

#### DAVID

No, just definitely still alive--

#### TREXEL

Obviously not like a regular person, but you know, sort of alive. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Like a way, like a pet dog is alive, you know. Or maybe a frog.

#### DAVID

Okay, all of those things are still just--

#### TREXEL

Or a horse, you know, the way a horse might be alive.

#### DAVID

Just alive.

#### TREXEL

Or like a cloud. In the way that a cloud is alive.

#### DAVID

No, a cloud isn't alive.

#### TREXEL

Or like a house.

#### DAVID

Nope, also-- that's an object.

#### TREXEL

Well, exactly. That's exactly what I'm saying. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You're like a living object, David. So, that's life of a sort.

#### DAVID [irritated]

Mm-hmm?

#### TREXEL

So, that's what I'm saying. You understand what life is, and what defines life? It's end. The mortal coil, it coils for us all and springs into your face when you're old! And kills you.

#### DAVID

Right, so you think Henkka is quite old.

#### TREXEL

Exactly! And as you get older, your bones drag down. Or if you haven't got bones, your exoskeleton chitinously cakes up so that your joints don't flex as much as they used to. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Or if you're a gas, you dissipate. There's less and less of you. Or if you're a liquid, you evaporate. Or if you're sort of paste, then you just sort of leave a sheen of yourself as you move and there's less as you go on--

#### DAVID

Okay--I think we can assume that Henkka is solid... [__TREXEL:__ Sure.] because they have joints.

#### TREXEL

Well, absolutely. [__DAVID:__ And they don't want winter.] Internal, external skeleton? Who knows? Who cares?

#### DAVID

Exactly. And assumedly winter is because their bones hurt when it's cold, or something like that?

#### TREXEL

Everybody hates the winter, and the elderly the most of all!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You've been alive so long, and winter's rubbish. And obviously we don't have winter. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] We're in a climate-controlled space station, David! But people do have winter on their planets. And it is a real bummer. A real bummer!

#### DAVID

Okay, so do you have any ideas about what you might want to do for Henkka's planet?

#### TREXEL [soothing]

##### [confrontational]

##### [soothing again]

Yes! It's a retirement planet. You've worked hard your whole existence, or maybe you haven't, I don't know who you are. Stop asking me questions! Get out of my bathroom! [__DAVID:__ Uhh.] And now, you need a time to relax. And a planet that just sits at the perfect meridian of... kind of warm, but not so warm that you're all sweaty and weird.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

A nice, relaxing planet.

#### DAVID

Like a balmy spring day.

#### TREXEL

A balmy spring planet.

#### DAVID

Sure. Yes! Great! Oh, well that sounds like a brilliant idea! Um, I think that just about wraps it up--

#### IMOGEN

##### [activation sound]

Would you like to submit?

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, come on. We can do better. We can do better! We're a team! We can work! We can build! We can forge. [__DAVID:__ Well, I--] We can conceive of worlds that, as of yet, no consultant has ever conceived.

#### DAVID

Okay, well that's forge--

#### TREXEL

##### [yells in confusion]

Because we are gods, David. Mainly me, but sort of you. You're like a god's hammer. No, that's too much. You're like a god's pince-nez. Perched on the end of the nose, allowing them to peer at their work. Clearing the vision slightly, perhaps, but you're so sort of weird. Why don't you just have glasses? Why do you just clip them to the edge of your nose like an idiot? Oh, they've fallen off into my soup!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Soup ruined. Security alerted!

#### DAVID

Well, let's forge a planet together.

#### TREXEL

Right. And to do that, I want to get a little personal, David.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

Now, I have never done this before, because most clones, most clones, I have never really... I'm gonna come out say it-- bonded with, David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I have brought my dream journal.

#### DAVID [weirded out]

Okay?

#### TREXEL

It's a collection of personal thoughts from my dreams, that I collected since I was a... since I was a little boy.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And from time to time I glanced through this journal to-- to come up with ideas to help me build planets. Maybe that's the secret to my success, David. Who am I to say? I'm just the universe's greatest genius. Now, I'd like to present some of these ideas to you, and together...

#### DAVID

Hmm?

#### TREXEL

...as co-workers...

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

...as colleagues...

#### DAVID

Sure.

#### TREXEL

...as two people employed by the same organization...

#### DAVID

That's true.

#### TREXEL

...as two people in a room together...

#### DAVID

Also true.

#### TREXEL

...as two organisms who metabolize sugars...

#### DAVID

Continues to be true.

#### TREXEL

##### [David hums unappreciatively]

...as a dog faithfully following its master into the moor of death during some sort of war... we are together going to build a planet from my dreams. Will you dream with me, David? Will you dream with me?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Please dr-- oh, he's going to dream with me!

#### DAVID

Okay, yes, all right. So we're gonna build a retirement planet around one of these dreams.

#### TREXEL

Or multiple dreams, David. Let's see how we get on!

#### DAVID

Right, well, maybe just one to start with.

#### TREXEL

First dream. Let's get the folder out.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [lullaby begins playing]

##### [lights power down]

Dream time! Dimming light.

#### TREXEL

Dream one.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I'm sitting on the edge of a ring.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

The ring is made entirely of stardust, and I am eating the stardust with a spoon. There you go. There's your first idea.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

Dream terminated. Un-dimming lights.

#### TREXEL

Could we have candy dust rings around this planet? You've worked hard all your life. You just want some easy calories to put in your face. You pop on a suit, you float out to outer orbit, you get a spoon, you scoop up some of that sugary lovely goodness, pop it in your mouth.

#### DAVID

D'you know what-- yes. Do you know what, Trexel, that's absolutely perfect. The client wants something with low gravity; what is lower than *no* gravity?

#### TREXEL

No gravity!

#### DAVID

So we're gonna have a planet where you spend a lot of your time doing spacewalks and yet-- you're, sure, you're eating candy rings. Brilliant. [__IMOGEN: [activation sound]__ Would you like to submit?] I think that's good to go--

#### TREXEL

But David, if there's no gravity, you'll just float off into the vacuum of-- you taught me that, David! Remember the trough moon? [__DAVID:__ You could--] You remember the trough moon with all the water escaping into space? We don't want that, especially not with the elderly! [__DAVID:__ Well, but you would tee--] They'll be really cross! They'll be like, "Why am I floating away?!"__ [DAVID:__ Well, but the planet can have low--] and then they'll get quieter as they get away-- "aaaaaahh..."-- y'know, because they're getting away from us.

#### DAVID

Yeah, yeah, I get why.

#### TREXEL

It's the perspective shift. It's sort of a sound-- Obviously, you wouldn't hear that actually, because it would be in space-- it's not important! It's not important, David.

#### DAVID

It'd be on the low gravity planet, [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] and they would be able to then take walks into space. [__TREXEL:__ I see.] But if we make the spacewalks a core part of the planet, then there's no gravity a lot of the time for the residents.

#### TREXEL

How about, how about this: everybody is already in a pretty comfy spacesuit. That's gonna be good for these elderly clients, anyway, because they need to be in a very controlled environment. They're very controlled all the time, you know. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] It takes care of their-- of their-- of their bathroom needs, [__DAVID:__ Mhmm, mhmm.] it delivers, you know, the core nutrients [__DAVID:__ Yes.] to them within this suit, they're in it all the time! You know, until they die! And then it just solidifies in some sort of person shaped coffin.

#### DAVID

Sure. Why not.

#### TREXEL

And you've clipped them in, it's a very low gravity planet and they can leap. Leap like when they were young! Up into the stars! And they're tethered on so they-- they look up and they see the candy dust in the sky. And they leap reaching with a spoon! Like-- like when they were young and people cared about them! And as they get up there they scoop up, scoop one little scoop, pop it in their mouth, and gently float back down to the planet's surface.

#### DAVID

Perfect again. [__TREXEL:__ Beautiful.] Absolutely beautiful, yes. And the suit can also support their joints to lessen the things, we'll have some sort of airlocked candy funnel so they don't explode...

#### TREXEL

Thank goodness you thought of the airlocked candy funnel!

#### DAVID

Yeah, well, you know, that's what I'm here for. So, brilliant! Right, let's submit that.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful, wonderful! That is-- that is a-- that is a great start.

#### DAVID

No, what? No-- I think we're kind of at a stopping point.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. I think-- well-- let's just kind of go back to the journal. Let's go back to the journal. [__DAVID:__ Okay, right.] That's a core start. Go back to the journal and see what else I've... dream-weaved.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Won't you dream with me, David?

#### DAVID

Oh, I'm dreaming with you, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Come to my dream loom, David!

#### DAVID

##### [makes brief snoring noises]

Look! That's me dreaming.

#### TREXEL

Oh, y-- that was wonderful, David.

#### DAVID

There was a thing on IMOGEN about people snoring.

#### TREXEL

Have you just been watching people sleep on-- on IMOGEN?

#### DAVID

No, it was--

#### TREXEL

It's a bit creepy, David. [__DAVID:__ It was in--] You've been watching videos of people sleep on IMOGEN? [__DAVID:__ It was a holovid--] You know, what David? Stop it. I like you, don't ruin that. Back to the dream journal.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [lullaby begins playing]

##### [lights power down]

Dream time! Dimming light.

#### TREXEL

##### [lullaby distorts]

##### [suddenly calm]

Okay, dream number two. I'm in a long corridor. There's shouting from behind. The shouting says: "Don't come back here, you insolent boy!" I'm running. There's wind in my hair, but where's the wind coming from? I see a light at the end of the tunnel. I reach towards it, but-- but it seems to be growing smaller, not larger. I'm falling. Falling. *Falling*! I wake up. And what could that be on this retirement planet, do you think?

#### IMOGEN [beep, lullaby stops]

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

Dream terminated. Un-dimming lights.

#### DAVID [disturbed]

Uhhhhhhhhhhhh...

#### TREXEL

##### [sound of page turning]

Well, what do you-- what do you think could represent this-- this sort of running in place but not getting anywhere? The recriminations coming from behind in the dark and the falling?

#### DAVID

Okay, well, as you get older... usually one's mobility might start to suffer... so we could have, as well as the low gravity spacewalks, a lot of gyms! A lot of places to encourage them to stay mobile. Running in place on a treadmill!

#### TREXEL

##### [shouts]

On a treadmill! In the dark! While people shout at you! [__DAVID:__ Okay, maybe--] "*Run, you stupid old idiot!*"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Nightmare insult gym patented.

#### DAVID

I think maybe that might be a bit too full-on for the elderly. Um, maybe the person speaking to them...

#### TREXEL [soothingly]

Run, you stupid old idiot.

#### DAVID

Okay, well yeah, but some sort of personal trainer. So, each resident--

#### TREXEL

"Hey, friend! Why don't you run, *Stupid*."

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Friendly insult gym patented.

#### DAVID

We're almost there-- actually, no, yes, that's perfect. That's just enough of the right blend of motivation and insult. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] So I-- I think, actually, at this point-- gyms and spacewalks, old low gravity planet, off we go! [__IMOGEN: [activation sound]__ Would you like to submit?]Done. Off into the next-- Into the brief you go.

#### TREXEL

But where... but where is the light, David? The light at the end of the tunnel! What's-- what's that? You're running in place, this-- there's somebody behind you, shouting at you, in this case encouragement, in *my* dream *recriminations upon recriminations*. But what's that light that you're running towards? [__DAVID:__ Uh, well...] Because to me, that says death. Are we having them-- is it a death treadmill? Are they running on a death treadmill with a-- with a countdown clock on it to their immediate death? [__DAVID:__ Uhh. No, that might be--]They're in a suit that-- that carries their vital signs and measures them all, so it knows exactly when they're gonna die. And you're running, and you're running, and you watch that clock ticking down, but as you exercise, it slows the ticking! It's got a death clock on it! And the more you exercise, the longer you live! And you're running and looking at that clock, saying, "*Please*! But a moment longer*alive*! I cannot *die*! I cannot *die! I will not die*!"

#### DAVID

*Yes*. Absolutely. We'll do that, but... we'll put a smiley face on it.

#### TREXEL

Little smiley face, make it less threatening. "Oh, gonna die!"

#### DAVID

But not yet!

#### TREXEL

Not yet though!

#### DAVID

Because you're running, and it's getting better. [__TREXEL:__ Whoopsie doodle!] Yes! And look, we can fake the clock and just make it go up, and people are running and running and running and having fun.

#### TREXEL

Subterfuge. You should-- we should-- we should rig the clock. [__DAVID:__ Well you know, just have it--] I didn't think of this. This is very... this is very unlike you. We're going to trick the elderly into thinking they're living much longer!

#### DAVID

Yep, very unlike me, that's David. Honest David. That's what they call me.

#### TREXEL

Old honest David, that's what they call you![__DAVID:__ Old honest "the seventh" David.]

#### TREXEL

Old honest David. Never told a lie in your life, have you?

#### DAVID [lying]

Never.

#### TREXEL

You haven't got very *long* to tell a lie, I suppose.

#### DAVID

Well, exactly. So I've told none.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes. Not a single lie.

#### DAVID

*Anyway*! So, uh-- having the death clock with a smiley face makes everyone feel good, because they're-- they're moving the reaper further away. Sounds like a planet! [__TREXEL:__ But everything's a lie.] Well let's just pop it in the--

#### IMOGEN

##### [activation sound]

Would you like to submit?

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, David. [__DAVID:__ Okay.]We've done great work. *I've* done great work. [__DAVID:__ Mhmm.] You've been here whilst we've been doing great work.

#### DAVID

Yes, it's been a pleasure.

#### TREXEL

Let's not stop now, David! Let's get another dream in there! I'm priming my dream loom, David! [__DAVID:__ Okay.] Wanna make a dream jumper? Perhaps some dream moccasins?

#### DAVID

Yes, I'll put on my dream wooly hat.

#### TREXEL

We can hammer some shoes of dreams for you and I to wear together. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Maybe we can both wear the shoes at the same time.

#### DAVID

Make a whole dream outfit.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's wonderful. Oh, we're dreaming together, okay. Let's-- let's take a final dream, David. Let's take one last dream!

#### DAVID

Yes, fine, yeah let's do that.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [lullaby begins playing]

##### [lights power down]

Dream time! Dimming lights.

#### TREXEL

##### [lullaby distorts]

##### [lullaby and speech both speeding up anxiously]

##### [muffled voice]

Oh, this is that good one, David, this is a good one. I'm making a public speech. [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] It's at the most important consultants' convention of the year: ConsultCon. The biggest event. Every consultant on Stellar Firma there, looking at me. Looking at me for guidance, for answers. [__DAVID:__ Mmhmm.] I've got an excellent speech, David. This speech will knock your face off, and I'm giving it, and they're loving it, David. [__DAVID:__ Mmhmm.] They're like, "Yes! Yes, we were wrong about you, Trexel! You're not an idiot, and don't go away and not come back!" And all of a sudden I realize, I look down, I'm entirely naked. Entirely naked in front of everybody. And the podium falls away. They can see everything. Some of them nodding appreciatively, like, "Okay, not bad!" Others, though? Entirely scandalized. You shouldn't be naked while public speaking. Unless you're a nudist and that's what you're talking about and telling people why they should be a nudist. I'm not, though-- I'm a planet consultant. And not only that, as I try to explain to them "I didn't mean to do it, I honestly put trousers on--" all my teeth are falling out. [__DAVID:__ Mmhmm.] And they're collecting, and I'm swallowing them, I'm choking on all the teeth and coughing, and coughing, and I try and pick up a glass of water. The glass is full of teeth. Maybe an apple will help me here. It's an apple full of teeth!

#### IMOGEN [beep, lullaby stops]

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

Dream terminated. Un-dimming lights.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [page turns]

So, I'm naked, and there's teeth everywhere.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

How is that like being old?

#### DAVID

Oh, well-- another brilliant, stupendous idea.

#### TREXEL

Thank you! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Thank you!

#### DAVID

Teeth and nudity relate to retirement because... people's teeth fall out when they get older... [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] ...which just means they need good dentures, so we need good dentists! [__TREXEL:__ Absolutely!]Free dental care for anyone on the planet who needs it, needs to get their gnashers replaced, pop them in, great.

#### TREXEL

New gnashers, whether you like it or not! [__DAVID:__ Exactly.]You arrive at the planet, they look in your face, doesn't matter if you're a species that had teeth beforehand or didn't. Maybe you had grinding plates because you're a vegetarian ungulate of some sort. Maybe you're actually some sort of a blood-sucking animal and therefore your teeth are hollow. Smash them all up with a hammer! "Welcome to the atomic planet!" Smash smash smash smash smash! You're getting standard dentures. You're getting standard dentures. We're all getting standard dentures.

#### DAVID

Maybe the inhabitants should get dentures which are *appropriate* for their physiology?

#### TREXEL

That will only cause problems, David. People will be very envious. You've lived a long time with one set of teeth in your life. And you're like, "Maybe I'd like--"

#### DAVID

We'll give them-- we'll give them options.

#### TREXEL

Give them options? They're old, David, you give people options, they get scared, they get frightened! You tell them what to do and if they say anything it's because they're old.

#### DAVID [fed up]

Yep, you know what, you are completely right. Everyone just gets a standard set of human teeth.

#### TREXEL

Smash out the teeth with a hammer, [__DAVID:__ Yep.] replace them with regular old human teeth. [__DAVID:__ *Perfect*.]They're the best kind of teeth, I should know, I've got some!

#### DAVID

Exactly. And, with their brand-new dentures, there is a newfound confidence. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Which means they are old, they are confident, they're single--

#### TREXEL

All their loved ones are dead--

#### DAVID

And that means they are--

#### TREXEL

Alone in the universe and ready to mingle! [__DAVID:__ Yeah. Sure.] All your loved ones are dead, no one's left to judge you! You've got your new dentures in, find somebody of any gender of your choice and just get down to Funkytown! Everybody's nude. You're so confident, aren't ya, with your lovely teeth and your newfound dead relatives. That means it's time to get the flesh out! Take off your top. Take off your bottom. Take off anything you had in the middle. Gyrate. Everything's going everywhere, and you're happy about that. And so is everyone else.

#### DAVID

...Great! So you've got two options: either completely nude or wearing a space suit?

#### TREXEL

Everyone's nude. Not only are the space suits translucent, they are permeable. You reach out and touch a partner of your choice in space, and BAM. You're both in one spacesuit. You're ready to mingle. You see someone across the starlit void? BAM. You're in the same spacesuit. And you're ready to mingle. You hear somebody shouting for a dog six miles away? BAM. You're both in the same spacesuit. Are you ready?

#### DAVID

To mingle?

#### TREXEL

To mingle! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] That's what you are.

#### DAVID

Perfect. Wonderful. Right.

#### TREXEL

Very quickly, everybody's gonna be in everybody's spacesuit and you're just in a big humping bubble in space.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hump bubble detected.

#### DAVID

Yeah!

#### IMOGEN

...Carry on!

#### DAVID

Absolutely. Eating candy rings.

#### TREXEL

Eating candy rings! ♪ A rainbow 'round a world... ♫

#### DAVID

Well that's *genius*! I mentioned this sort of *airlock system*, for the candy ring, but actually, if the spacesuits are permeable, people could just spoon it straight into their faces. [__TREXEL:__ Straight into their faces.] You know what, Trexel? You've done it again.

#### TREXEL

You know what, David? I've done it always.

#### DAVID

Yes. So I'm just gonna pop this brief [__IMOGEN: [activation sound]__ Would you like to submit?]into the tube and away it goes!

#### IMOGEN

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

#### DAVID

Another winner from you, Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

Another big W from the dream team of Trexel Geistman, Trexel Geistman, Trexel Geistman... supported by David 7.

#### DAVID

Yes, absolutely. Well, you must be in really good spirits from that, so...

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

Absolutely, David, and I-- I want to thank you for, uh-- you know, to a certain extent, indulging me. I don't share my dreams often, I was worried that you would think they were, um... stupid.

#### DAVID [quickly]

No, they were wonderful. Anyway. [__TREXEL:__ You really think so, David?] Yes, absolutely. You should probably go have a celebratory drink at the Cosmic Lounge.

#### TREXEL

You're-- you're encouraging me to go for a celebratory drink?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You never, you never really approved of my drinking before, David. I-- well. I-- I suppose I will. Maybe-- maybe two drinks. Maybe three.

#### DAVID [overlapping]

Maybe three. Maybe four.

#### TREXEL

You really think so?

#### DAVID

Oh yes, you know, reward yourself. You've done very well today.

#### TREXEL ...

Thank you, David.

#### DAVID

That's fine.

#### TREXEL

Thank you very much.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

I'll-- I'll see you tomorrow, then.

#### DAVID
