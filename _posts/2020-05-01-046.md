# __EPISODE 46 - GONK AND__

# __GRANDIOSITY__

## Transcribed 5/5/20 via stellarscripts on tumblr

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Jon Clark. May your smuggling ring never become a smuggling semicircle.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [footsteps approaching]

Right. So, Hartro's working for Standards, and Standards wants me, but also Trexel, to do... well because we're supposed to be in Sales but--

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

##### [David yelps]

♪ A new dawn! A new dawn has come to pass! ♫

#### DAVID

Trexel, we need to talk.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ The mistakes of old are now cast-- ♫

#### DAVID

Trexel, we need to--

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ --aside to reveal a brand new future shining bright in the sky! Trexel! ♫

#### DAVID

Needs to listen to me.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ Trexel-- ♫

#### DAVID

Really needs to listen to me.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ --has arrived-dah! ♫ [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Cheering! Cheering! Cheering!

#### DAVID

Uh, no. No. No cheering. Look, Tr-Trexel--

#### TREXEL

Cheering.

#### DAVID

Trexel, we need to talk!

#### TREXEL

Fireworks!

#### DAVID

We need to pro-- No, Trexel. We need to properly talk. Please get off your chair! Just *talk* to me.

#### TREXEL

What is there to talk about, David? We are back on track. I was so worried that my career was over, David, with the lead weight that is David 7 dragging me down, [__DAVID:__ Oh wow.] down the departments, down-- down the, down the hierarchy into the, into the doldrums of, of Expediting, but no. No, the Executive Track is ours once again, David, it will be within our grasp!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

It is possible that the Executive Track *might* be clouding his judgement.

#### DAVID

No, but I think the Executive Track might have a big blade at the end that's gonna chop us up as we sit on this track going, "Oh, off we go to the Executive land."

#### TREXEL

The world of business is sharp. You have to expect knives, David. Knives are merely a way to sharpen your own wits! Sharpen a knife on a knife! Try it, David, it works!

__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Business knives detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

But I think Standards might have nefarious schemes.

#### TREXEL

Who doesn't have a nefarious scheme. I've got three nefarious schemes running already and you don't look at me and not trust me.

#### DAVID

Oh really? What are they?

#### TREXEL

Oh wouldn't you like to know, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Well, I'll tell you. Scheme 1: the canteen's always running out of their premium slurry. Oh, you try and get there early, you get there at 10 o'clock in the morning and ah, no, sorry, we're all out of the premium slurry. It's all been sluiced over to the Executive Lounge but--

#### DAVID

Wait, h-hang on. Hang on.

#### TREXEL

--what I have-- What? No, no, David. Let me, let me finish. I have threatened the employees to keep back a side, a side sluice just for Trexel. Mm, premium slurry for me! That's a nefarious scheme; it involves blackmail.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

In comparison to your other crimes, it could almost be considered farious.

#### DAVID

Can I just off-- Okay. So, when have you ever been in that canteen at 10 o'clock in the morning?

#### TREXEL

Well, no, I-- I meant, David, if one *had* turned up at 10 o'clock in the morning, it would have already been gone. And if it's already gone at 10, why bother turning up until 4 with a nefarious scheme that means it's been kept back. Think about it.

#### DAVID

But have-- have you ever been at 10?

#### TREXEL

Work smart, not hard, David.

#### DAVID

Have you ever been there at 10 to test whether they're out of premium slurry?

#### TREXEL

David, I've never been anywhere at 10.

#### DAVID

Well, so how do you know they're out of premium slurry?

#### TREXEL

Because it's 10. Nothing's good at 10. Think about it!

#### DAVID

Right. No, I-- I have thought about it. I am often up at 10--not out because I can't--but I'm up at 10, and 10 is a perfectly fine hour.

#### TREXEL

Well, maybe it's a fine hour for clones, David, but for Trexel, for a finely tuned... sales machine, consultancy machine--

#### DAVID

Yes, who's, hmm, no longer a consultant.

#### TREXEL

--now expeditory machine.

#### DAVID

Mm. And has sold zero things, remember. So when you say this lead weight of David 7, what you mean is "Trexel Geistman has been unable to sell any planets to anyone because he's not actually very good at sales!"

#### TREXEL

I have moved beyond your negativity, David. I have moved beyond this well of sadness that seems to always cloud this, this whole space over here. I'm waving my arms just towards this whole space [__DAVID:__ Right. Yeah, great.] over towards your side of the room.

#### DAVID

Yeah, just go ignore this whole well of sadness.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Let's be positive. Yeah, let's be positive, David. We're back on track. The drinks I had with Hartro when she wheeled me out and she took me to a small bar, not, not the Cosmic Lounge, but also importantly, not the Astral Bar.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

The Asteroid Booth.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And we had a quiet, a quiet drink in the Asteroid Booth. Her--sitting in a plush leather couch; me--in an increasingly small cage with a half-sized glass. It-- it wasn't ideal, David, but think about it. This is progress. We can be back in with a chance of being top executives!

#### DAVID

No, but Standards are going to *do* someth-- They are going to use us for a thing, and we don't know what it is, so we shouldn't just--

#### TREXEL

I'm cutting through the noise, David. I'm cutting through the noise. We need to get on with our job. Come on, stop wasting time. Let's get on with the job, let's sort out a problem, let's get back in the good books, and let's sort our careers out, okay?

#### DAVID

Fine. Fine. Let's just-- let's do well enough that we're not gonna be killed, okay. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Maybe we should take a little bit of time to try and work out what Standards has in store for us before just running along the Executive Track to fall down a big pit full of spikes.

#### TREXEL

This seems complicated, David, so what I'm gonna say is you do you, I'll do me, and we'll just see what kind of cheese falls out.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Do not eat the mystery cheese.

#### DAVID

Okay. I don't know what cheese has to do with it but I'm gonna do me. So--

#### TREXEL

##### [intense]

It's all about the cheese, David!

#### DAVID

Alright. Well, we still have a job to do, so let's do this job. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Off we go.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initiating.

##### [pneumatic tube seal breaks, closes tube door]

#### DAVID

So our next complainant is Gonk. Uh, Gonk's pronouns are him/his.

#### TREXEL

##### [in a pitying way]

##### [sighs]

Oh Gonk.

#### DAVID

What, do you--

#### TREXEL

Oh Gonk.

#### DAVID

You know Gonk?

#### TREXEL

Oh Gonk. [__DAVID:__ Do-- do you--] Sad, sad Gonk.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You met Gonk?

#### DAVID

Wha-- Obviously not.

#### TREXEL

Oh Gonk. Oh dear.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Tell me about the complaint and I'll-- I'll tell you a little about-- Oh Gonk.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, Gonk, as I guess you know, works in the--

#### TREXEL

Oh Gonk.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

--cleaning department. Right? Uh, and what Gonk does is he "cleans up after everyone. All the time. Not that anyone notices or thanks me." You know what, Gonk? Yeah, I get ya.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Class solidarity will not be tolerated. Employees must stand alone. Weak, vulnerable, and alone.

#### TREXEL

That sounds like Gonk. Old Gonk. "Oh, oh, nobody notices what I do." Oh Gonk!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay I--

#### TREXEL

Such a bummer to be around, you know?

#### DAVID

Really? Really.

#### TREXEL

Nobody wants to be with that-- nobody wants to be-- "Oh oh, I wasn't invited to anything. Oh oh, you don't look me in the eye when you walk past. Ah, there seems to be some acid burns on the floor and you're holding a vat of acid, Trexel, so maybe you should be more careful." Oh Gonk, just can it, Gonk!

#### DAVID

Right. Um, you know what? I-- Yeah, I'm, I'm kind of seeing-- I'm seeing-- Would you say Gonk is sort of a well of sadness?

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I mean, I've not looked into how, how deep Gonk's sadness is but, I mean, there's a divot there and that divot's full of water. You know?

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Sadness water.

#### DAVID

Yeah, your-- your-- Yes, your disdain starts to make more sense. Anyway, his complaint is, uh, that "how am I meant to mop in zero gravity, especially when I don't have a mop?" So, it looks like Gonk has a tough job to do that nobody cares about and nobody thanks him for, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and he doesn't have any of the skills or equipment [__TREXEL:__ Nope.] in order to do his job. So...

#### TREXEL

It's hard to do what you're supposed to do when you have faulty equipment or unhelpful coworkers, and it sounds like [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Gonk's got faulty equipment and no coworkers!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighing]

Oh Gonk! What a sad life you must lead.

#### DAVID

Well, uh, Mister--

#### TREXEL

Gonking about the place.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Gonking into a corner. Gonking down a hallway. "Oh, who's that? Is it Gonk?" "I don't care." You know.

#### DAVID

Right. Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Tricky stuff.

#### DAVID

Okay. And, um, so, so Mr. Trexel "Executive Track" Geistman, how would you try to expedite Gonk's problem?

#### TREXEL

Well, as a perspective Executive, or Prosepecutive as I like to say--

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Portmanteau detected. Securlerted.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

I wouldn't deign to notice someone like Gonk. The people that far down on the chain, they're like-- It's like how you don't notice certain gases hanging around. Oh, look there's some nitrogen. I've breathed it in, I've breathed it out. It's inert. It's more of, like, a vehicle for better things like oxygen. Think of it like this--Gonk is nitrogen, I'm oxygen. Gonk's important, but who do people really care about? This gas. This gas over here. Old O2 himself. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Trexel "O2" Geistman.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So I don't think we should really, you know, lower ourselves to the, to the problems of someone like Gonk. If we're trying to get back on the Executive Track and they're like, "You're troubling yourself with Gonk? Oh Gonk!" You know, that's not gonna give the good-- that's not gonna give a good, a good impression, is it?

#### DAVID

##### [subtly ridiculing Trexel]

Oh, right. So you think that maybe we should just tell Gonk that "we're sorry we can't help you, we're just too important."

#### TREXEL

Now you say it back to me, that doesn't seem like the kind of thing that's gonna look good in a report.

#### DAVID

Oh. Oh, no no no no no. No, I think that's a great idea. I think we should definitely do that.

#### TREXEL

No, no, now you-- now you've said that back to me, I-- I think maybe we should try-- David, I think you've--

#### DAVID

Oh. No no no. No, sorry, sorry. Just let-- let-- what--

#### TREXEL

I think you've dismissed Gonk too quickly.

#### DAVID

No no, just--

#### TREXEL

I think you should give Gonk another chance.

#### DAVID

Well, no-- Ah, well, why don't you give me another chance. I'm gonna say it in a different way, [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] and we'll see how it sounds. Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

Hit me with it.

#### DAVID

"Gonk, as a valued member of Stellar Firma, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] I'm terribly sorry about your problem. [__TREXEL:__ Good.] However, I'm on the Executive Track, and as somebody on the Executive Track I need to focus on being an Executive, and in order to do that best I just don't have the time to deal with your problem. Have you thought about talking to your line manager? Lots of love, Trexel Geistman, brackets Executive Track."

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

Yes but that doesn't, that doesn't make me sparkle. That makes me-- Yeah that-- You look at that and you think, "okay, you know, technically they're not wrong" but I haven't demonstrated any skill there, have I?

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

I want them to really see me sparkle. So what I'm gonna say is we're gonna arm Gonk. You've got to get people's attention! If you've got a gun, you've got someone's attention.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Not all attention is good attention.

#### DAVID

Ah, okay. Right, so, so what you're saying is, um-- This sounds like a good idea, actually. Yeah, so instead of giving Gonk a coworker or equipment, you instead give Gonk a gun.

#### TREXEL

Well, not necessarily a gun because, you know, a ranged weapon, that's a little bit, that's a little bit full on. But maybe a hammer.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

A really dangerous big hammer. And Gonk's running down the hallways going, "You never noticed me! Now it's Gonk's time to shine!" [__DAVID:__ Okay.] And people are like, "Hmm, that guy, I think we should give him a broom."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Uprising watchlist updated. Gonk-Geistman liberation front under observation.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, so it's more, um, give a man a broom [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and he'll just be able to do his job. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] But give a man a hammer and he'll be able to find all of the brooms that he wants.

#### TREXEL

That sounds like a-- Can we get that on a pillow? Could you stitch that on a pillow? David, I'm going to find some crochet materials and I need you to put that on a pillow so I can then hand it to an Executive at a meeting and say, "Have you seen my pillow?"

#### DAVID

##### [unzips bag]

##### [roots around the bag, crochet hooks clank together]

Oh, well I've actually got some crochet materials in here actually. I've been practicing a little bit. Look.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Arts and crafts detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. Like-- like show me some.

#### DAVID

##### [hands over craft]

I'll just-- Here. Oh, so here's, here's-- So, I've got this.

#### TREXEL

Okay that's-- that's a very lovingly crocheted Bathin. Okay. Any-anything else?

#### DAVID

##### [hands over craft]

Yes. Okay, yeah. Um, oh! I've got this.

#### TREXEL

Okay, that's a, a less clothed and equally lovingly crocheted Bathin. I hesitate to ask this David, [__DAVID:__ Right, because of the--] is there--?

#### DAVID

No, I have a third one. Here, here we go.

#### TREXEL

##### [flips pillow]

Okay, that is *full* Bathin! That's all the Bathin I need to see! Let's just flip that pillow over because [__DAVID:__ Okay.] no one needs that!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Even when knitted he's got it in spades.

#### DAVID

Well I-- I mean, I mean. I don't know, it's pretty alright.

#### TREXEL

Have you-- have you ever considered, you know, stitching, stitching like an inspiring quote from me on a pillow?

#### DAVID

##### [makes several gagging noises]

Oh, now--

#### TREXEL

##### [David continues gagging]

Wha-- what's happening? What's happening, David? Some-- something seems to be wrong with you. David, are you ill? Are you quite well?

#### DAVID

##### [gags, swallows]

Ah, no. Oh sorry. Sorry Trexel, I was just overtaken by a mysterious... fungus.

#### TREXEL

##### [David gags again]

##### [splash]

Okay, well what I was saying is I say amazing things, put the things I say on a pillow. No, it's, it's happening aga-- David, David, do you need some sort of stomach calming fluid? Hang on, [__DAVID:__ Well, I've got--] I've got, I've got this-- Anyway, now drink this. D-drink this! Drink this!

#### DAVID

No. That's a puddle!

##### [Trexel and David struggle a little, Trexel forces David to drink the puddle water]

#### TREXEL

There we go. The puddle water should soothe your gullet.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

Ahhhh. Eugh! Oh yes, oh so soothed. Yes, um, I'll never have to do that again. Oh! That's cured me.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

So, if we arm Gonk [__DAVID:__ Right.] and people, people respect people who are armed, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] for better or for worse. [__DAVID:__ Yep.] And in my experience, David, always worse. If you've armed yourself to get attention, do you get that attention? Yes. Does it make you a good person? No, it makes you that one that everyone's frightened of. [__DAVID:__ Right.] I should know,I've waved a lot of weapons in the air in my time.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

If there's a watchlist, he's on it!

#### DAVID

Ah, and you're on the Executive Track, so it's got to be a good idea for Gonk.

#### TREXEL

It's got to be a good idea! Hang on David. This is, this is an interesting philosophical point. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] If I'm now on the Executive Track--which I am, we can all agree--and everybody who is on the Executive Track is amazing, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] therefore everything I've ever done, regardless of the consequences at the time, must have been amazing.

#### DAVID

Uhhhhhhh, I don't think that--

#### TREXEL

I've-- I've been quite circumspect in, in respect to myself at times, I think you'll agree, David. I'm my own worst critic. I'm always like, "Alright, I know you like Trexel, but he's got faults! He's got problems, too." But, but now you've said that-- Maybe, maybe I am unequivocally, without any reservation at all, the most brilliant and perfect person that's ever lived. And I know that because I've been externally confirmed as on the Executive Track.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

It's logically sound as long as you've been severely concussed.

#### DAVID

Okay, so what you're saying is we're gonna get a new Trexel, a *more* confident Trexel. A Trexel who is a little less self-reflective.

#### TREXEL

I am... a literal god.

#### DAVID

Uhhh, no that-- No no no. You're-- you're a literal-- maybe on the Exec--

#### TREXEL

David, I have a stone tablet I'd like you to peruse. Now--

#### DAVID

Okay, no look--

#### TREXEL [brings stone tablet out]

##### [sighs]

It's got my ten Trexmandments on it. Now, [__DAVID:__ Oh. How--] number 1: Trexel is always right, even when his advice seems particularly wrong.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Commandment 2: Give Trexel your stuff. [__DAVID:__ No, no.] If Trexel wants it, Trexel gets it.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

In fact, why am I reading this? I'm a god, I've got plenty of things to do. Come on, come on, David. Read out my Trexmandments.

#### DAVID

Right. Right. Okay. Okay. Number 3: Bathin's an idio-- I'm not reading that out.

#### TREXEL

I-- I think you shou-- Read it out. Read it to your god.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

No, I'm not-- Number 3--

#### TREXEL

##### [mutters as he reads further on]

I'll read it. [__DAVID:__ Right.] "Bathin is an idiot! Bathin has always been an idiot. Bathin will always be an idiot." In fact, 6, 7-- The rest of them are just variations on the phrase "Bathin's an idiot". "Bathin's a ding-dong. Bathin can shove it. Bathin who?" That one's cutting because it's, it's as if I don't know who Bathin is, you see? So, you know, I--

#### DAVID

Bathin is like my third nipple--vestigial.

#### TREXEL

Exact-- exactly! You know, um, you know a bit of fun there. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] Tryin'a make it about me. Tryn'a bring it 'round, because you know, [__DAVID:__ Oh yeah.] this-- I'm a vengeful god, I'm an angry god, I'm also a fun god. I'm a god that invites you 'round for table tennis.

#### DAVID

##### [sighing]

Okay. Well, so this fun god's recommendation to Gonk is that Gonk should get hold of a big hammer.

#### TREXEL

Now, could that backfire? I'm not saying that because I think it might, because as I say... I'm an invaluable god, but let's just throw it out to, to David. Can you see any issues with that? I'm Gonk.

#### DAVID

Me? Me-- Okay, David 7 your, your trustworthy and honest assistant who only has, uh, your best interest at heart.

#### TREXEL

I mean, you wouldn't betray a god.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

No. No, of course not. And-- and do you th-- do you think that I could see--

#### TREXEL

##### [performing a kiai]

Haa! Haa! Haa!

#### DAVID

Any...? What are-- Are you-- [__TREXEL:__ Haa!] What are you tryin'a do?

#### TREXEL

I'm trying to fire lightning out of my hands. Hee-ya!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Haa! [__DAVID:__ Right.] Ah, turns out I'm not that sort of god. Anyway, sorry, what were you saying?

#### DAVID

Okay, but you're-- you're wondering if I, David 7, am seeing any--

#### TREXEL

Hooooooooooooooo-ah!

#### DAVID

--possible... problems--

#### TREXEL

Hoooo. Is anything levitating?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Hoooooo.

#### DAVID

Hmm, no.

#### TREXEL

Okay, not that, not that kind of god either. [__DAVID:__ No.] What kind of god am I? Sorry. Sorry David. On-- off you go. Off you go.

#### DAVID

Okay. And if there could be any possible-- uh...

#### TREXEL

Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa! Haa!

#### DAVID

Okay, wh-what is this? What are you trying to do now?

#### TREXEL

Haa! Haa! Have you got my thoughts in your head?

#### DAVID

I think you're thinking about how great you are.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

I'm that kind of god! I'm a telekinetic god! I move things with my powerful mind! It makes so much sense, David. My mind is my gift, my gift to the world!

#### DAVID

##### [exhausted from Trexel's shenanigans]

Okay. Good.

#### TREXEL

But anyway, what's your thought about arming Gonk?

#### DAVID

Right, so yes. So, so can I see any ways that arming Gonk instead of giving them a mop could backfire?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

No. I think it's absolutely perfect.

#### TREXEL

Absolutely perfect.

#### DAVID

Oh yes.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful stuff. Wonderful stuff.

#### DAVID

Oh definitely.

#### TREXEL

Right, anything else in this, uh, in the complaint suggestion thingy that we need to be aware of?

#### DAVID

Uh, well, um, so they don't have a mop. Um... oh! And they, they can't mop the floor in zero gravity. Now, I-I don't know if that's because they don't have a mop--

#### TREXEL

They're in zer-- they're in zero gravity?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

This is-- this is so important, David. I can't believe you didn't mention this before!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [sounding like he's getting further away]

Think about-- think about the physics question of this! You're holding a big hammer to get respect. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] You swing at an object, but if we're all in zero gravity, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] you just float backwards when you strike it. You get one hit in and then all of a sudden, you're floating backwards, waving your arms and legs in zero gravity saying, "I wanted a second striiiiiike!" And then you're just tumbling-- That's not impressive or threatening!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [sounding like he's getting further away]

This invalidates everything that we've been thinking about, David. Think about it. If you're waving a weapon in the air, [__DAVID:__ Right.] and then you strike something, [__DAVID:__ Uh-huh.] you're just gonna float backwards in zero gravity, waving your arms and legs all over the place going, "I want to hit you again but I can't 'cause I'm tumbling away!" [__DAVID:__ Oh.] That's not threatening! That's not, that's not gonna gain anybody respect. You've got to think about Cramshank's Third Law of Moveability!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Ah--

#### TREXEL

"Each action makes other things happen, I suppose."

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. Well--

#### TREXEL

He was a very casual physicist.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

He has a point, but there is no record of Cramshank or any laws attributed to them.

#### DAVID

Yes. Uh, well, still makes sense, um, and-- and-- So, the core of this problem is when you have a hammer, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and you want to hit something multiple times, you won't be able to.

#### TREXEL

If you throw the hammer, you'll just move backwards to the equal amount of mass that went forwards backwards forwards backwards!

#### DAVID

Right. This makes total sense. Yes, of course. So the main issue is, yes I-I hit somebody or something, I want to hit them again and I cannot.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

But what if I had a bigger hammer so that I never wanted to hit them a second time.

#### TREXEL

Ah! My secret is the first hammer blow is the *last hammer blow*.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

And in that particular instance you might not need to hit anyone at all. If everyone's like, "Wow, that hammer, that's a big dangerous hammer. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] I don't even want to get involved. I don't want to have to see if I can survive a first strike." You just, you just, you know, do what they say.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

This is how the problems started back on Earth.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You give them a mop. Maybe even two mops. Maybe two mops and a bucket, you know.

#### DAVID

Exactly. Well-- a well--

#### TREXEL

A man can dream.

#### DAVID

Exactly. So, so with this way, we give them a massive, massive hammer. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] And instead of giving them a mop, we give them the ability to threaten or dismember somebody so that they get a mop and some buckets as well!

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

##### [sounding like he's getting further away]

And then it goes from "Oh Gonk" to "Oh! Gonk!" then to " Oh Gonk!" And you're sort of, you're with Gonk and you're patting him on the shoulder about a joke and then because you patted him on the shoulder you both float away. And then as you both float away from each other you're like, "Bye Gonk! You're my friend now because I was frightened of you!" And what better way to make friends than to frighten people.

#### DAVID

Well there you go.

#### TREXEL

Friends threaten friends always. That's the saying.

#### DAVID

Well, wow, we must be the best of friends then.

#### TREXEL

I've always thought so, David, and I'm glad you've come 'round to that fact.

#### DAVID

Right. Yes. Thank you, my lord, my god.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

##### [chuckles]

...I-- I never thought you'd actually call me that, David. I... I'm touched. You know, when we are sipping champagne on the top deck, height of our careers, captains of industry both, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] I'll remember this. And as I continue to try and shoot lightning out of my hands across at another executive that I don't like, I'm gonna look over at you and think, " I could have never got here without David." [__DAVID:__ Well, I th--] Maybe I'll give you a chair.

#### DAVID

##### [walls begin to groan as they compact]

Okay. Well, good. Lucky me, I'll get a chair. So, I think, well, the mor-- Oh, the walls are moving in, so we need to get this delivered, but we're happy with this? You think that's all good? Yeah?

#### TREXEL

I-- You know what, David, given that I'm a god, I think we should see if the, if the walls can crush me, because I'm pretty sure they can't 'cause I'm a god. [__DAVID:__ Okay. Yeah.] So don't submit it. [__DAVID:__ No, what a--] Let's see what happens.

#### DAVID

##### [faking agreement]

##### [chime]

Oh yeah, no, great idea. Let's just do that...

#### IMOGEN [pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

#### DAVID

##### [walls stop moving]

Oh! Oh no. Look, there it goes.

#### TREXEL

Awwww, David!

#### DAVID

I slipped. I slipped.

##### [alarm beep, walls retract]

#### TREXEL

David, I wanted to see if I could destroy the walls with my deific form!

#### DAVID

Yes. Okay. Right, well...

#### TREXEL

Oh beans!

#### DAVID

Okay, well, no. Since you said you were gonna keep trying to fire lightning at that executive across that table, I think you should probably get on with practicing that, so maybe just--

#### TREXEL

I should. I should.

#### DAVID

--pop on down to the Astral Bar and just try and kill the barkeeper with--

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Not the Astral Bar. Not the Astral Bar, David. As we've established, David, I cannot find anything from before. But, I do remember the way to the Asteroid Booth, so I'm going to [__DAVID:__ Okay.] scuttle into, into the one little chair in there and ask the barkeep for a tall glass of whatever the drink is they have that night. They only ever have one drink every night. It's a bit weird, but you know what, the variety is good for me. I'm a god now, I need new experiences to broaden my horizons. And then say, "Get back horizon! I command you!" And then I make it, like, daytime in the night-- I'm not sure what the limits of my power are, but I need to discover it in the, [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] in the Booth. So, just--

#### DAVID

In the Asteroid Booth.

#### TREXEL

Just sit there--

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

--and think about your new life that's upcoming, [__DAVID:__ Right.] and I'll be over here--and by over here I mean not in this room, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] which is pretty much everywhere else because if this is in here-- It's not important, David. The thing is I'm leaving. Good-bye!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Okay, bye! Oh, he's gonna be even more insufferable than normal. Agh, right.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David, I was just outside the room, [__DAVID:__ What?!] and I was just telling you through my mind to prepare me a cake. Now, did you get that, David?

#### DAVID

Uh, yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

I am that kind of god!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Okay. Bye Trexel! Bye!
