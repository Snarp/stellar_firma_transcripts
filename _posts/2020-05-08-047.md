# __EPISODE 47 - WEATHERBOY AND WORKING OUT__

## Transcribed 5/12/20 via stellarscripts on tumblr

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Leif. May all your escape tunnels be structurally sound.

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [exercising, out of breath]

6,542... 6,543... 6,544...

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Further clone swolening detected. Security concerned. Do they even lift?

##### [footsteps approach]

#### DAVID

6,545...

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

No, don't bow. Don't--

#### DAVID

Uh. What? Oh.

#### TREXEL

David. David!

#### DAVID

Oh, hello.

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

Yes. What?

#### TREXEL

##### [irritated]

I taste in the air [__DAVID:__ Mm?] the salty fug of clone sweat! You're on the floor, David, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] and you're doing upsies-downsies! This is exercise, David! What did we discuss about exercise?

#### DAVID

Uh... that I should do it whenever I want because I'm here on my own.

#### TREXEL

That doesn't sound like something I'd say. I'm pretty sure what I said was, "Stop it. It's weird." And anyway, David, with all this exercise you're illicitly doing in the background, why are you exactly the same shape as you've always been? Still a noodley little clone wand of a thing.

#### DAVID

##### [pokes belly]

Uh, I-I mean, I don't know. Uh, all I'm doing is-- Look, I'm doing this because it makes me feel better, right? Um, and I, I really feel a bit harder if I poke my belly.

#### TREXEL

More like denser?

#### DAVID

Yeah. Yeah, like--

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Like a-- like a-- like a piece of hardwood.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Woo! Ow! Oh! Yeah! Ooh! Yeaah! Ooh! Ah!

#### TREXEL

Okay, stop-- stop-- stop poking yourself and giggling, David. That's not the kind of *vibe* I want to go for in here.

#### DAVID

##### [mutters]

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Fine. Alright. What you do in your own creepy, weird, sweaty time is, is your business. And doing things simply for the fact of making one feel good is an impulse I can respect. Certainly my years of substance abuse are virtually entirely based off that principle. So if the substance you're abusing is exercise, I don't like it, David, but I respect it.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Well, I don't respect it, David, but I'll allow it. Well, I'm not allowing it, but I'm not willing to take the steps to prevent it.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Warning: your own time is a concept incompatible with staff guidelines. All time is company time.

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh--

#### TREXEL

Anyway, what's been happening in my world you ask? No, you didn't ask [__DAVID:__ Mm.] because you're selfish, David. Because you're a selfish person who doesn't ask me. Go on, ask me how my day was.

#### DAVID

##### [begrudgingly playing along]

How was your day, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Oh, is that your business? Is that business of yours to ask me? The answer--

#### DAVID

Oh. Alright, no.

#### TREXEL

--yes it is. [__DAVID:__ What?] So, I was in the Asteroid Booth trying to move glasses across the desk with my mind. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] And it wasn't working. So I turned to the barkeep and with my mind I said, "Barkeep, another pint of crème de menthe." And he didn't do anything at all, just continued to look away in the very small space in which we both were not talking. So I was thinking, "How can I be a deity?" because we're pretty sure I'm a deity, David. You know that's the case.

#### DAVID

##### [emotionally tired]

Yes. Yes. Oh yeah. No, we're definitely sure about that.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammering]

##### [softly]

##### [softly]

But my powers, they seem to be illusive, not particularly evident but I must have them. And then I thought, "Wait!" I know what kind of god I am, David. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] I'm a god that works in... *mysterious ways*. Oooh, yes. "Why did that happen?" Well, *mysterious ways*. "Why-- why do-- why do good people die young?" *Mysterious ways*. "Why have I been hit with that boulder in my genital area?" *Mysterious ways*. You see?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Cowper detected. Security investigating mysterious "Light Shining out of Darkness".

#### DAVID

O-okay. So-- so you're basically just saying if anything happens, you'll attribute it to yourself--

#### TREXEL

And if it's good, it's because I mysteriously did something good. And if it's bad, ah, don't question the plan. The plan is *mysterious*. You see? It's the best kind of accountability--unaccountable accountability.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, uh, on that note, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] is doing our job in your mysterious plan?

#### TREXEL

Ah! I'd answer that question but I'm mysterious.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, it looks like-- Oh! Ooh! Ooh, your mysterious ways have made me pick this brief up!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

##### [pneumatic tube seal breaks]

#### DAVID

Ooh and now I'm *reading it*!

##### [closes tube door]

#### TREXEL

Well, if that's what happened, David, it must be because that's what I intended it to be.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right. So this one is from Welby Weatherby. Um, their pronouns are he/him/his. Um, and he works in Maintenance [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] as an Interior and Exterior Atmospheric Control Monitor.

#### TREXEL

Well, it's a very important position, David, because guess what?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Atmosphere--it's what you breathe, it's what you live in, it's what you do. It's like the furniture of the air. You know?

#### DAVID

Uh-huh. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Like, if you went into a room and there wasn't a chair and you tried to sit down, you'd fall over and bang your bottom. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] Nobody wants to do that. Similarly, if you went into a room and you breathed and there was no atmosphere, your lungs would fall over and bang their lung-bottoms.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay. Well, well the problem that Welby Weatherby has in the Interior and Exterior Atmospheric Control Monitoring line of work is, uh, is that "my coworkers in the Maintenance department keep calling me Weatherboy. That is NO--"

#### TREXEL

##### [taunts]

##### [sings]

Because of Weatherby! Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Ah ha ha ha! Weatherboy! Ah ha ha ha ha! Weatherboy! What's that Weatherboy? Testing gases? ♪ Weatherboy, Weatherboy, weather weather Weatherboy! Weatherboy, Weatherboy, weather Weatherboy. Who's that Weatherboy? It is you. What's the Weatherboy? Tell me true. Is it raining? Is it shining? Tell me, Weatherboy, am I pining for the time when the Weatherboy was here? Now the Weatherboy is here it's clear, there's a Weatherboy, Weatherboy, Weatherboy! The boy of weather is you! Ha! ♫

#### IMOGEN [beep]

When that is your approach to bullying, it hurts *you* more than them.

#### DAVID

Yes. Um, I think-- I'm gonna finish this sentence and I think that might be actually the root of, uh, of Welby Weatherby's complaint, uh, that sort of, uh--

#### TREXEL

What's Weatherboy got to say for himself?

#### DAVID

Well, uh, "my coworkers in the Maintenance department keep calling me..." the-the-the thing. Um, I don't want another song. Um, "that is *not* my name nor my job title! My job--reminding IMOGEN that we are not all AI and need certain temperatures and gases to survive--is *important!!*" And there are two exclamation marks there, [__TREXEL:__ Mm, two.] so it's probably quite important.

#### TREXEL

Very important.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

I don't forget. I just sometimes forget to care.

#### DAVID

##### [whispers]

##### [normal]

"Honestly, I think IMOGEN might have started this! Please stop this *Weatherboy* nonsense before it take--

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

What's that? [__DAVID:__ Hmm?] ♪ Who's there I see across the sea? It's a Weatherboy, a Weatherboy, a Weatherboy coming to me! ♫

#### DAVID

It's actually Welby Weatherby.

#### TREXEL [sings]

♪ Tell me what the weather is. Weatherboy, tell me true [__DAVID:__ Weatherby.] for the weather, weather, weather, weather is something you do! ♫

#### DAVID

So that-- yeah, something that Wel-Welby Weatherby does. Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ He's a Weatherboy! ♫

#### DAVID

Ok-- no. Weatherby.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ He's a Weatherboy! ♫

#### DAVID

Weather-- Weatherby.

#### TREXEL [sings]

♪ Play with your weather toys! ♫

#### DAVID

Weather-tee.

#### TREXEL

##### [sulking]

Well, now you've ruined it.

#### DAVID

Good. Anyway--

#### TREXEL

You've ruined the meter.

#### DAVID

Okay. Does that mean we can-- Okay.

#### TREXEL

I suppose so. I mean, [__DAVID:__ Right.] the-the-the meters ruined now so just, just move on. I don't care.

#### DAVID

Okay. No, that's fine. So, I just have to ruin meters and that will just-- Okay, that's--

#### TREXEL

No, don't learn that! Don't-- I don't want you to learn that! That will ruin all my fun!

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

##### [counts them]

Well, meter or no, it's a, it's-- that nonsense, uh, is taking over Weatherby's life. Um, "my name is", um, this is all caps with *three*, one, two, three exclamation marks--

#### TREXEL

The most amount.

#### DAVID

##### [over the top]

--"*Welby Weatherby!!!*"

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

##### [mutters]

Right. So, they're very insistent that they're not--as fun as it is--they're not Weatherboy. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Ha ha ha! Sorry. Control yourself. But they are Welby Weatherby.

#### DAVID

Did you have a song you'd maybe like to sing about this?

#### TREXEL

No. No. No.

#### DAVID

No?

#### TREXEL

I'm being professional and we're moving on because--

#### DAVID

Okay. So Weatherboy is not-- Maybe you wanna--

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

Not a thing. Doesn't-- Not a thing I-- N-no__. [clears throat]__

#### DAVID

No?

#### TREXEL

Nothing I worry about. No.

#### DAVID

##### [sings]

Okay. ♪ Welby Weatherboy, you have come with your boys to control the weather. Here you go. Lovely love-- ♫

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ Look, you control the flow, the flow of the weather through all the sky. Look outside, it's time for guys! Guys from, from-- ♫

#### DAVID

##### [changing the meter]

##### [continues singing gibberish]

♪ Guys from thathn. Guys to time. Guys to time with thum-some-thum-thum. Some tha blu blah ba-be-dap-ba! Bo whap ba ba ba boo! ♫ End of the song.

#### TREXEL

##### [grumbles]

I see. They call him David 7, [__DAVID:__ Hmm?] meter ruiner.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Or ear saver depending on how you look at it.

#### DAVID

Mm. I don't know. I only work in feet and inches. That's all I can say about that. Anyway--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Metrology puns will not be tolerated. Security alerted. If you give people an inch, they will take a mile.

#### DAVID

We need to try and sort this problem out. Don't we, Trexel? 'Cause we are on... the Executive...

__DAVID and TREXEL:__ --Track.

#### DAVID

So, how are you going to solve this problem in an executive manner?

#### TREXEL

So, he does make a point in there that he thinks that the generator of this mean nickname is IMOGEN, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] and that is believable. IMOGEN [__DAVID:__ Yes.] does have a little bit of a habit of doling out nicknames to people when she's irritated by them.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

That's the kind of rumour spread about by *fools*, like Weatherboy.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

So, for example, I, uh, I have a colleague, Fredrick Hammerwell. Now, Fredrick Hammerwell works in the Catering department, and insists that the slurry should be changed or seasoned-- it's something that IMOGEN isn't interested in. IMOGEN's all like, "it's got nutrients" and Fredrick's all like, "well, maybe we should make it tasty", and then all of a sudden, he and his family have disappeared. And after they all disappeared, all of a sudden everyone's remembering him as Fredrick Hammerfail. And everyone's being like, "Remember old Hammerfail?" And I'm pretty sure it's because a note went around from IMOGEN saying, "Call him Hammerfail or you'll disappear." So, you know? It seems reasonable. But what that *also* means is it's a dangerous game to come in and mess with it. We can't just go in and say, "No, IMOGEN's wrong. Ignore that memo." That way disappearing lies.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Threatening memos detected. Everyone keeping quiet if they know what's good for them.

#### DAVID

Right. And has-- has IMOGEN ever given you a nickname, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I mean I... I don't think so. I don't-- Hang on, I'll just check. IMOGEN, have you ever given me a mean nickname so people make fun of me?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Focus testing revealed the name that caused most derision was Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

Ooh.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Well that's-- Well, that's... that's unkind. That's an unkind thing to say. I think the name Geistman has gravitas [__DAVID:__ Hmm.] and respect and I, I don't think it is... a jo-- a joke. Anyway, the thing-- I don't have one.

#### DAVID

Oh. Just-- just one moment. Um, IMOGEN, have you ever given me a nickname?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [chime]

Generating nickname based on individual's personality profile. David 7, more like David Heaven.

#### DAVID

Oh, that's very nice.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Oh, well-- now-- Okay, fine. I'm not gonna-- I'm not gonna sink to [__DAVID:__ Mm?] you two's level. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] You have your little thing going on. Your little, your little secret fun where you like each other and stuff.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

##### [defensive]

That's-- that's no-- that's not important to me. I'm on the Executive Track. I'm gonna be an Executive. You can, you can, you can foray which-- with whichever AI you want while I'm sipping glasses of sunshine on the top deck.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

He's acting like a real Geistman if you ask me.

#### TREXEL

But anyway, my point is we can't just go in and negate it. We've got to fight fire with fire.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

If you've got a mean nickname, make up another mean nickname and spread it around and then let the crowd decide. Welby Weatherby's name is gone. You're never gonna be Welby Weatherby again. But perhaps we can think of a better nickname than Weatherboy, spread it about a bit.

#### DAVID

So, okay. Uh, Welby Weatherby needs a new nickname that isn't Weatherboy. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Uh, but we need to try and work out maybe a nickname that, that Welby would like [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] instead of hate with a three-exclamation mark passion. Uh--

#### TREXEL

What about [__DAVID:__ Hmm?] Wellgood Weatherboy. Nope. Still got Weatherboy in it. [__DAVID:__ Mm.] Um, what about "way to go, Weatherboy"? No. It's still got Weatherboy in it.

#### DAVID

So, it looks like Welby--

#### TREXEL

Wahey! Weatherboy! Sorry. Sorry, that's still wrong.

#### DAVID

That's just, that's just an exclamation not a name.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. Yeah.

#### DAVID

Um, well, so it looks like... Welby is most annoyed that it, it's not their name. That's gone. They ne-- they have-- they don't have a name.

#### TREXEL

Their name is gone.

#### DAVID

Their name is gone.

#### TREXEL

They may as well have been born an egg with no name and a face drawn on it.

#### DAVID

Yes. Uh, so... the other aspect is that it's not their job title.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

So, if we can give them a nickname that is maybe related to their job title, which is Interior and Exterior Atmospheric Control Monitor, then maybe they'll be more satisfied because at least that nickname is more descriptive of their role.

#### TREXEL

Okay. What about IAEXACMO? Hey, IAEXACMO!

#### DAVID

IAEXACMO.

#### TREXEL

Want a beer?

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Right. Well, maybe. But, but also, it's not really got anything to do with Welby Weatherby as well. So--

#### TREXEL

Wahey! IAEXACMO!

#### DAVID

No, okay, you've just-- That-- that's still an exclamation of the same thing, it's not actually a name.

#### TREXEL

Alright, you're bringing me lots of problems, David, you're not bringing me many solutions.

#### DAVID

Okay. How about we call them... Welby "Interior and Exterior Atmospheric Control Monitor"-by.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Swing... and a miss.

#### TREXEL

And you-- and you think that's gonna catch on, do you?

#### DAVID

Uhhhhhh....

#### TREXEL

Do you know anything about people?

#### DAVID

##### [counting number of people]

Well-- no. I have met one, two, three, four... five?

#### TREXEL

Five people.

#### DAVID

Five people.

#### TREXEL

And out of all those five people, you've not identified anything about what people might like. Is that what you're saying? Is that you're saying you're unobservant? You're saying you're not paying attention?

#### DAVID

Usually they're just shouting at me.

#### TREXEL [getting louder]

##### [yelling]

You can learn a lot more about someone when they're shouting than when they're quiet, David! I should know, I'm always shouting, and everybody knows the name Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hubris detected. Security unsurprised.

#### DAVID

Well, everyone definitely *hears* the name Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

The point I'm making is that people like snappy. They like sort of zhuzhy and, and easy to roll off the tongue. Not too many syllables or maybe something with a bit of a beat to it.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You know? Just saying the whole thing--

#### DAVID

Alright. Uh, what about, uh... oh, I don't know, um, Welby Atmos?

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Welby Atmos. Hmm. "I'm not sure about these figures." "Have you asked... Welby Atmos?"

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

Silence falls across the room. A shiver across everyone's faces. "Welby Atmos!"

#### DAVID

Exactly. Yeah, W-Welby--

#### TREXEL

Or maybe just Atmos, and they sound like a mysterious figure drifting in space. "Who's that up there?" "It's Atmos." TM [™].

#### DAVID

Alright. Well, maybe Atmos. Well, let's just, let's just workshop a little bit more of, of-- We've just-- That's atmospheric. Um, Contra.

#### TREXEL

Welby Contra. Welby Contra. I can see that. Maybe, maybe you're, uh-- maybe you're, you're, you're out running, let's say.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And you see Welby Contra coming alongside and you're like, "Eh, I think I can defeat Welby Contra 'cause that name is snappy. But those legs, those are thin legs." So you're running and you're running, and you're coming up to Welby Contra and you're passing and you're passing him. Yes! You've beaten Welby Contra! And then you turn to him and say, "What did you do, Contra, walk? 'Cause guess what. I ran, Contra."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Employee access to remaining Earth historical archives under review for reasons of public safety.

#### DAVID

Okay. So we've got Contra, we've got Atmos. Uhhh... What else could we do? Uh... Uh...

#### TREXEL

The Monitor!

#### DAVID

The Monitor.

#### TREXEL

No Welby, just... *The Monitor*.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Did you check with... *The Monitor*?

#### DAVID

You could be like, "Look. I know you're very confident. I know you're-- Lisa, I know you're very confident but did--"

#### TREXEL

Lisa, please! Let him speak!

#### DAVID

"But did you check with The Monitor, Lisa? Did you check?"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes!

#### DAVID

Okay. And that's got a certain amount of gravitas, doesn't it? You know, I think, I think Lisa's really gonna, really gonna listen to The Monitor and, and then, you know, once The Monitor has given his opinion to Lisa, uh, she-- she will probably respect that, that opinion because, because it's such a good opinion from such an authoritative, uh, name of The Monitor, [__TREXEL:__ Yep. Yes.] and, uh, and I think that might bring a smile to her face.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Double yikes!

#### TREXEL

David, I don't know why but I hate this. I hate this in a, in a way that's really fundamental. There's just something about that that... that makes me wanna... push your face until it becomes flat on the wall.

#### DAVID

Oh. Uhhhh...

#### TREXEL

But hey, there's no, there's no bad ideas. The whole point of this exercise is--apart from that--there's no bad ideas. But now we've got lots of options and they all--apart from one--seem, seem to have equal merit, you know? We've got, we've got, uh, we've got the Atmos. We've got Contra. We've got... INEXAGMAG... whatever that one was. It's all there. But, but how do you choose?

#### DAVID

Ah-- well. How do you choose? We just-- just throw them all out there.

#### TREXEL

Yes! The choice is not choosing at all. Like all good policy decisions, the right choice is to sort of do *everything* so you can deny anything. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Scattergun marketing, David! Push them all out the door, [__DAVID:__ Alright.] whichever one works you draw a target around it and say, "That's what we were going for."

#### DAVID

Yeah, we'll just-- just throw th-- throw them all out there. [__TREXEL:__ There you go.] Throw them all out into the ether. Um...

#### TREXEL

We see what sticks.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

##### [breaks into laughter, starts singing]

##### [crosstalk]

But I've got to admit it's gonna be a hard ask against ♪ Weatherboy! How are you doing? Weatherboy, it looks like clouds are looming! It looks like-- ♫

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk, singing a different meter from Trexel]

♪ It's Weatherboy. Weatherboy. It, it is Weather-- It is Weatherboy. It is-- ♫

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

I will hurt you, David!

#### DAVID

What? No. Mm? I've been doing a lot of lie-down crunch-ups.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

Wha-- wha-- what'd you think you're-- you think you're stronger than me now?!

#### DAVID

Yeah! Go on! Go on!

#### TREXEL

You think you're a big man?!

#### DAVID

Yeah, take-- take a swing! Take a swing at-- take a swing at my stomach! Right. Go on.

#### TREXEL

What-- what, you're asking me to take a swing?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Like a proper swing?

#### DAVID

Oh, yes!

#### TREXEL

Not like when you're-- not like when you're not looking and I can push you over or hit you. Like a proper--

#### DAVID

Oh no. No no.

#### TREXEL

See it-- Okay.

#### DAVID

I'm gonna look-- I'm locking eyes. Come on, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Oh. Okay, fine. But you're-- but you're letting me do this, right?

#### DAVID

Yes. I, David 7, give you, Trexel Geistman, permission to have a go and give me a punch in my stomach.

#### TREXEL

Fine.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Right. Let's wind it up.

#### DAVID

Yep. Just really, just really whirl your fist around. Yep.

#### TREXEL

Wind up one of these. Oh, you don't know what's coming, David!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel grunts, thud as Trexel punches David's stomach] [in pain]

'Cause the train's pulling into the station! [__DAVID:__ And...] Toot-toot! It's the 5:15 to pain town! Owwww. My hand.

#### DAVID

I'm sorry. Did, uh...

#### TREXEL

Ow. You've smashed my hand with your washboard chest!

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel groans]

No, I'm pretty sure you smashed your hand *upon* my washboard chest.

#### TREXEL

##### [breathing deeply in pain]

Ah. Oh, this is bad, David. [__DAVID:__ Hmm?] This is-- this is really bad! I think I've broken my fingers.

#### DAVID

Ok-- Well, no--

#### TREXEL

##### [gags]

##### [groans]

I'm throwing up a bit in my mouth.

#### DAVID

##### [bones crack into place, Trexel cries out]

Well, no, just-- just look. Just, just... calm down just a second. [__TREXEL:__ Uh-huh.] Just l-let me take a look at that. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] And... whoop!

#### TREXEL

##### [relieved]

Ooooww! Ah, it's in line.

#### DAVID

There you go.

#### TREXEL

Oh, thank goodness! Not broken, dislocated. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] And as much as that white-hot stab of pain has sent me into a bit of a rage spiral, at least my hand moves again.

#### DAVID

Yes. So...

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Okay. Well, okay. Fine. So, you've-- you've-- you've-- you've put on-- you've put on a bit of timber, as the people say, and you've harden up and, uh, [__DAVID:__ Mm.] looks like you're a strong, strong boy. So let's, um...

#### DAVID

The lie-down crunch-ups have done their job.

#### TREXEL

Yes, well I'm going to do the sit-down drink-ups, I think.

#### DAVID

Yes, and that's working very well for you, I've seen.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Clone confidence levels rising. Security intimidated by the clone abs.

#### DAVID

But-- Okay, so we're gon-- we're gonna throw all these out here, we're gonna throw all of them out there, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and they're-- they're gonna go and do something. I have-- I have--

#### TREXEL

And-- and whatever sticks, whatever sticks sticks.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

I have been wondering, is anything gonna stick? Like, where do these go?

#### TREXEL

What do you mean? They go up the tube.

#### DAVID

Yeah, but then-- but then what? But then where? Like, how do they-- Do we--

#### TREXEL

That's none of our concern, David. That's none of our concern. They go up the tube and then you just stop worrying about it. It's a-- it's a bit of a different situation here, David. Like, when we were doing, when we were doing planet consultation, sure, we put them up a tube but then we got a bit of feedback. Something's happening with the planet, you know. That's-- that's going on. When we were doing sales, we go and meet them in the room. In this world, we put it up the tube, we never see it again.

#### DAVID

Well, exactly. There's no--

#### TREXEL

But you've just got to assume it's probably fine, I suppose.

#### DAVID

##### [walls begin to groan as they compact]

##### [straining noises from putting the brief in the tube]

Ugh. Uh, yeah. Fine. No, I suppose. Yeah, I-I suppose you're right, and-- Oh! Oh, the walls are going. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, yep. Oh.] Okay. Right, well, that-- that's the one bit of feedback I'm getting, and--

#### IMOGEN [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting!

#### DAVID

There it goes.

##### [alarm beep, walls retract]

#### TREXEL

There it is. And I-- I think you should really just let that go, David. I don't think you wanna pick at that particular scab, because as soon as you start asking, "Is what I'm doing something that matters? Are my ideas and suggestions actually being implemented in any way? Am I making a difference, or am I just in a metaphorical, and sometimes literal, sense screaming into a void of hopelessness and pain?" As soon as you start to go down that route, you're sitting in front of a pint of crème de menthe. It's not a good look, so I'd just, just be happy with what we've got, David. We're on the Executive Track. Don't rock the boat. Just keep, keep on with this and, and it'll all be fine!

#### DAVID

##### [unconvincing]

No, fine. Sure. Yes. Alright.

#### TREXEL

And you're not gonna-- and you're not gonna stress exercise in my absence because you're still worrying about this, right?

#### DAVID

Well, uh, I might do some, uh, "sit down but not quite sit down so your bum does not touch anywhere and then stand up again...'s".

#### TREXEL

Fine. Fine, if that's, that's what you've got to do then that's what you've got to do.

#### DAVID

Well, yep. I've-- I've-- I've got a bunch of these, you know, "sit down but not quite so your bum doesn't touch anything and stand up again's" to do, so...

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes. And I've got a... couple more pints of crème de menthe waiting out for me.

#### DAVID

Right. What is crème de menthe?

#### TREXEL

Crème de menthe--it's like someone's yelling into your mouth, and what they're yelling is "fresh"!

#### DAVID

So it's a fresh yell of a drink.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

It is a fresh yell. A fresh yell to take the edge off the fresh hell. [__DAVID:__ What--] Anyway, I'll leave you to this, and you leave me to that, and then we'll all be on the Executive Track. ♪ But look outside, what can you see? The Weatherboy is here to decree what the Weatherby, the Weatherby, the weather will be! Oh! ♫

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

##### [starts doing squats]

Right. Well... fine! One... two... three...
