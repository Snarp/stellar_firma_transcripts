##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [groaning quietly]

##### [high pitched and anxious]

##### [inhales]

He's not here. I know he said he specifically wasn't going to be here, but I kind of didn't believe him...  Oh, Trexel, we've only got about half an hour left, come on... I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die 'cause of an idiot. 'Cause of a late...

##### [footsteps approaching, door swooshes open]

##### [David yelps]

__TREXEL__: David!David, we are running *so* short on time. David, I can't believe you've let this happen! [__DAVID:__ What?!] David, I-- have you *seen* the clocks? There are clocks all over the place [__DAVID:__ Yes!] and I've seen them, and they are saying it-- we've only got about--what?--thirty minutes, a little bit less than thirty minutes to get this done? David, what-- what have you been doing? What have you been doing, just sitting here in the dark?  [__DAVID:__ Yes! Tha--] I'll turn the light on.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

__TREXEL__: See now you're just sitting here in the light as well! Come on!

#### DAVID [cries out slightly in pain]

Okay.

__TREXEL__: David, David, do you not understand what's happening? [__David, irritably:__ What?] We have a review, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] With Hartro Piltz. [__DAVID:__ Yes...] *Tomorrow*. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] And she's going to go through all of the planets we've done. And I don't want to worry you, David, but thus far-- thus far? Thinking back? Not good. None of them good, David. And she's gonna run through them with her judging eyes and angry face, and say, "Why? Why, Trexel? Why have you done it like this? And *David*, why have *you* done it like this?" And do you know what happens if she decides they're bad?

__DAVID__: ...I die!

__TREXEL__: You die! And more importantly, I get a stern reprimand. I don't want that! I don't need that in my life! So we've got to get it together, David. [__DAVID:__ Right!] We've got to get it together and we've got to do a really great job on this one.

__DAVID__: Well it's good that we have a cool... about a half an hour to do it then.

##### [defensively]

__TREXEL__:  That's a little bit more than we've had before! [__DAVID:__ Well... I su--] What do you want from me?! I'm really-- I've got a lot on, David! [__DAVID, skeptically:__ Mmm... ] Come on, re-- get the brief, get the brief out of the tube.

#### DAVID

Okay, okay. Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

__DAVID__: So, this brief is... from... oh, um, the lead singer and only surviving member of "The Winter Lettuce Collective".  __[TREXEL:__ Oh, *my*!] Is that-- I've never heard of them.

#### TREXEL

They're the biggest known band! Well, they were, until most of them died and there's only one left, now a solo artist, but they're pretty important, David.

#### DAVID

Okay, well, um, so this would be a really good one to impress...

#### TREXEL

Hartro!

#### DAVID

Yes...

#### TREXEL

Our line mana-- did you forget the name of our *line manager*, David?

#### DAVID

I've never met her.

#### TREXEL

If you drop this kind of... cack in that room while she's talking w-- you are *done*.

__DAVID____, weakly:__ Hartro.

#### TREXEL

Hartro.

__DAVID____:__ Hartro.

#### TREXEL

Piltz.

__DAVID____:__ Piltz.

#### TREXEL

Hartro.

__DAVID____:__ Hartro Piltz.

#### TREXEL

Piltz.

__DAVID____:__ Piltz.

#### TREXEL

Look at me.

__DAVID____:__ Yes...

#### TREXEL

Hartro Piltz.

__DAVID____, whispers:__ Hartro Piltz.

#### TREXEL

Go on.

__DAVID, relieved__: Okay. So this would be a really good thing to impress Hartro with, [__TREXEL:__ Excellent.] um, it says to "reflect in every sense the brilliance of the client", [__TREXEL:__ Hmm.] and it must include a "mood ring sky".

#### TREXEL

Right. [__DAVID:__ So...] Is that *all*? [__DAVID:__ Yes! Jus-- ] Ugh, that's broad. It's a *broad* brief, David, and a broad brief is like a double-edged battleaxe. One edge cuts your toast, the other edge cuts your face.

#### DAVID

Tha-- okay. So we're gonna make toast with this planet.

#### TREXEL

Don't get lost in my metaphor, David! Don't get lost. [__DAVID:__ Okay. I'm back.] Now we need to make a planet that reflects. Now, the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective-- Normally what we might do in this situation is take a look at the client. Who are they? [__DAVID:__ Yes.] What do they like?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Winter Lettuce Collective Factfile.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

So those questions to you, Trexel, because you... have not been alive... for three days... in this room.

#### TREXEL

Ooo, you've turned it 'round on me, David, you've turned it 'round. Okay, well, the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective, nobody knows their name, or indeed their species. A shadowy entity.

__DAVID, hesitantly:__ Okay, so the planet's quite dark?

#### TREXEL

Well, it could be quite dar-- but we can't just have a *dark planet*, David, "Oh, oh we've made you a black orb." Ooo! Oh maybe they're a *goth*, maybe they'd like a black orb. But I don't think they're-- The Winter Lettuce Collective did quite upbeat sort of like...trance-y music.

#### DAVID

Oh right! So w-- w-- uh, uh, uh, they, uh, bands do singles, right? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Well then name some of their singles, we might get some ideas about what the-- the lead singer thinks is-- is about their brilliance.

#### TREXEL

Well, we could go to the hits, you know, uh, uh, "Cosmic Loving", [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] "The Wind Beneath My Ear", [__DAVID:__ Okay... ] That was a-- that was a *really* lovely song it was, um, it's about, uh, the Capiens. They have, like, really long, flowing ears, and so when the wind picks up in the mountains they flow back, it's very nice, it's very nice, it's like hair for us.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Oh!  So was that sung in sort of the first person or the third person?

#### TREXEL

No, fourth.

#### DAVID

Fourth person.

#### TREXEL [lisps]

Fourth perthon.

#### DAVID

So it was about... the Capiens, but from the perspective of somebody else but in the past.

#### TREXEL

Can you see why they're a such successful band. [__DAVID:__ I can.] Who can write in the fourth person other than The Winter Lettuce Collective? No one. No one. It's a shame most of them died.

#### DAVID

So the lead singer writes the lyrics?

#### TREXEL

Uh, unknown. Suspectful, but unknown. [__DAVID:__ Okay, so they are--] They are-- they are, as I say, quite shadowy. [__DAVID:__ Right, so--] Quite private.

#### DAVID

--some sort of suspicious library, then.

__TREXEL, surprised:__ Sus-- suspicious library?

#### DAVID

Well, if we suspect that they may have written the thing...

#### TREXEL

Oh David, yes, that-- that's a good-- okay, so. 'Cause we need a *base* planet and then we need to talk about the-- the-- the mood ring, but let's come-- let's come to that later. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] So the base planet: what does a songwriter like more, and what does any creative like more, other than the sound of their own voice, [__DAVID:__ Ooh!] but a large, established retrospective of their work. [__DAVID:__ Ah.] A vast library--audio, visual, text--of all of the songs and poems, and-- and multimedia experiences of The Winter Lettuce Collective.

#### DAVEL

Okay! So we could build them some sort of *massive* pod for the lead singer.

#### TREXEL

Ooo, a po-- David, do you want to do a pod planet?

#### DAVID

We could do a pod planet.

#### TREXEL

We've never done a pod planet. We've done more regular planets, but we do-- now, technically speaking, is a pod a planet? Who can say?

#### DAVID

Let's check the chart!

#### TREXEL [crosstalking]

Let's check the chart.

#### DAVID

Okay. __[IMOGEN:__ Initiating.__]__

#### TREXEL

It's under other.

#### DAVID

Hmm, oh! No! There it is! A pod is definitely a planet. If it's big enough!

#### TREXEL

If it's big enough if it's-- you know what, there's a saying we have in this business. "If it's big enough-- It's a planet!"

#### DAVID [crosstalking]

It's a planet. Ooh I got it!

#### TREXEL [impressed]

Well done, David! You actually got that one as we went along. [__DAVID:__ Well...] It went lovely.

#### DAVID

Well, from context I picked it up quite well! [__TREXEL:__ Ahh.] It's a good rule.

#### TREXEL

##### [David gasps]

##### [stutters]

You love a context clue. [__DAVID:__ Yes, I do.] Okay, so we make a massive pod. So, so this will be, um, this will be planned where it's not on the outside, it's on the inside. [__DAVID, softly:__ Right.] You walk in, the gravity shifts, you expect to be walking along the surface's the planet, you open a door, you walk in,  you-- you do that flip round the door, you know, where, where your feet sort of curve round the door-- it's really cool,  and y-- and your heels curve round the door and then, BAM, and you're upright inside a pod.

#### DAVID

Okay, and your legs don't break. Which is good.

#### TREXEL

No, no, it's a very nice tr-- well they *can,* but what do, is you have a levely-- lovely gentle transition on the gravity.

__DAVID__: Also, we don't even know if the lead singer has legs, so...

#### TREXEL

##### [high pitched and confident]

It's a good point! I've just assumed that. You know what? That's my prejudice-- that's my prejudice, just assuming that they have legs. I've got legs! Most of the people I know have legs, and I've just gone and I've assumed.I'm pretty sure they have legs because of their song: "Look at my legs," brackets, "of love?" [__DAVID:__ Ohh, Okay. Well then--] So you'd think, [__DAVID:__ So the--] you'd think probably legs.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Probably lovely legs

#### TREXEL

I mean, obviously you can sing about legs and not have legs--

__DAVID__: In the fourth person.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

##### [pauses]

But-- or on the fourth or-- even in the sixth if you-- if you really want to go for it. But probably  has some legs. Anyway.

#### DAVID

##### [pause]

Ok so now they've got in the door, *with their legs...* __[TREXEL:__ with their legs.] what are they met by?  They are met by, you said so-- their all of their greatest hits? Playing at them...

#### TREXEL

What, all that once? [__DAVID:__ well...]  Would that be discordant or would that be transcendent?

#### DAVID

The Winter Lettice Collective, were they at all-- um-- anti-establishment-- Did they play with the-- the-- the limits of music?

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel deepens his voice]

They definitely played with the limits of music. [__DAVID:__ So..] They would tease the limits of music, they would hide of limits of music's bag, and say "Where is it? Where is your bag?" and the limits of music would be like "I don't know!"

#### DAVID

So maybe this is like punching the limits of music in the face?

#### TREXEL

Yes! yes. So how'd-- wait. So how're we representing that? We'd just-- we'd just put through play everything?

#### DAVID  [crosstalking]

By playing all of their songs, all at once.

#### TREXEL

That would be *horrible,* wouldn't it? [__DAVID:__ Maybe.] It would be discordant because they did many styles -- multi-instrumentalists, multi-stylists, playing different -- at different times in their-- their career lasted at least, *gosh*, 100 Cycles?

#### DAVID [makes indecisive noise]

##### [Trexel putting on headphones] [David whispering]

Okay, well, actually hang on a minute, I think I've been playing around with some of the-- of the console's stuff, I think I can get a thing that would give me the access. If you put on these headphones... Winter... Collective...

#### TREXEL

You're just gonna play it straight through to headphones? Play everything straight through my headphones.

#### DAVID

Straight into your headphones. I won't be able to hear it, nor will the builders who are recording this, but, uh, it will definitely-- I just want to see your reaction when I hit the play button.

#### TREXEL

Ok, ok. I just, uh, pop these on?

#### DAVID

Yep! And, uh, just gonna press, uh-- give me your thoughts. Just let me know what you hear. I'm going to press play... now.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL

Okay, I'm just going to pop these off. I have voided my bowels, David. I have entirely voided my bowels. Now--

#### DAVID

Was it a good void or a bad void?

#### TREXEL

You know what, David, I'm not entirely sure. I don't know if it was because it was transcendent and beautiful or if it was because it was terrifying and reminded me of the limits of my life and existence, but either way, I am now sitting in a pile of my own filth. So, I'm not entirely sure and correct me if I'm wrong, but for goodness sake *do not correct me if I'm wrong,* that whatever the reason for a void boweling-- or a bowel voiding-- Not ideal. Not what you'd-- you'd want when you've designed a planet, so--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Project deleted.

__DAVID__: So that's a no.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

So that's a no on all of the music together. I'm going to  We haven't got time to change so I'm just gonna have to sit in this and, uh, if it starts to-- starts to smell, David, just keep it to yourself.

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [gentle sound of a fan]

Air purification initiated.

#### DAVID

Okay, so not that. [__TREXEL:__ No.] So what happens when you come into the lobby?

#### TREXEL

Maybe there's just, like, a nice-- a nice butler. [__DAVID:__ Yes!] A nice butler with a fresh pair of trousers [__DAVID:__ Oh, maybe.] saying "Good morning, Sir, Madam, or Entity. Would you like a fresh pair of trousers that you haven't soiled?"

#### DAVID

I feel like your personal experience is-- [__TREXEL:__ No, no, no. No.] is intruding into the design of this planet.

#### TREXEL

##### [through gritted teeth]

No, everybody wants a fresh pair of trousers when they come and-- come home, because maybe somebody's  caused them to void them.

#### DAVID

I'm still getting a sense that this is more about you than it is about the *planet*, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Maybe a shower! Maybe a shower in the lobby.

#### DAVID

Again, is that to wash [__TREXEL:__ A shower!] the filth off of Trexel?

#### IMOGEN [beep]:

Air purification system overloaded. Increasing power.

__...__

#### TREXEL

Or.

#### DAVID

A.

#### TREXEL

Nice.

#### DAVID

Big.

#### TREXEL

Thing.

#### DAVID

Which.

#### TREXEL

You.

#### DAVID

Can.

#### TREXEL

Have.

#### DAVID

For?

#### TREXEL

A.

#### DAVID

Dessert.

#### TREXEL

You know what, that's nice. That's nice. Alright, okay, I won't make this all about me and my horrendous trousers. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] You walk in, somebody goes, "Here's-- Here's a treat. [__DAVID:__ Yes!] Here's a sweet treat." You can choose what that sweet treat is.

#### DAVID

Is the treat in some way related to the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective?

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

Yes, yes, yes, okay, we're going to get into the reflection. The treat is coated  with crystals.

#### DAVID

So you see yourself?

#### TREXEL

##### [David hums]

So you see yourself. You see yourself a million times reflecting back. Ooh! Take a spoonful of the lead singer of the Winter Lettuce Collective. Mm! Mm! Mmm! So unctuous, so tasty, so *me*, y'know?  That'd be nice. And then--And then you--you--you're going to walk into, um, uh, into--into a sort of, uh, storage facility, because all of these audio recordings, video recordings, so and so forth, they've all got to be stored somewhere, David! [__DAVID:__ Rebrand!] Rebrand? [__DAVID:__ The Grand Atrium.] Oh, David! You walk into The Grand Atrium, and there in the finest and rarest woods are housed all of your recordings through your entire career. Music, songs, dance moves, uh, advertisements, promos, everything.

#### DAVID

Right, they-- well, they've done a lot, they-- you said they've been around for a hundred cycles, so there must be enough to fill it full of it! [__TREXEL:__ Absolutely, absolutely.] Do we know anything about wha--what else the lead singer likes except for The Winter Lettuce Collective? Some sort of memorial to their dead bandmates?

#### TREXEL

Well, this is where it becomes a little more difficult, David, because th-- the circumstances under which The Winter Lettuce Collective became the only surviving member of The Winter Lettuce Collective is-- is a dark and not entirely clear tale. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] They began after their massive international and interspatial success to, uhm, disappear.

#### DAVID

One by one?

#### TREXEL

One by one. Like a dim stoner.

#### DAVID

Like a rotting lettuce.

#### TREXEL

A tour bus would fall into a sun, a promotional shoe would explode on a foot taking somebody with them, a, uh, van full of cheering fans would-- would pull up to their house and they'd let them in and night and they'd just tear them apart. One by one, The Winter Lettuce Collective became but one singular entity left...The one we have today... So what I'm saying is, I'm not sure if they orchestrated the murders and therefore wouldn't *want* a constant reminder of that thing they did. [__DAVID:__ Ah! Okay!?] We could make it optional.

#### DAVID

Yes the-- [__TREXEL:__ Make it optional.] Wait! Ooh! We could have the two rooms! Two galleries which is one is the "I Murdered The Other Members Of My Band" gallery [__TREXEL:__ Excellent.] and the other one is the "The Members Of My Band Were Tragically Killed In A Series Of Unrelated Accidents" gallery.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Exactly. And then what you do is, you walk into the Grand Atrium, y'know, first day in, you choose one door, you lock the other one, never look at it again. [__DAVID:__ Exactly!] Maybe put a-- Maybe put a shelf over the plaque that we'll put there.

#### DAVID

Ooh! Maybe, um, we can rig it with explosives and give them a button.

#### TREXEL

Oh, and they just explode it right there and then. [__DAVID:__ Yeah.] Just demolish-- demolish the memories like they destroyed the evidence. Or! Like they destroyed the completely unrelated accidents where they were nowhere near at, and had an absolutely fantastic alibi for. [__DAVID:__ Exactly.] Wonderful! Wonderful. Okay, well, that's a good *start* then. That's a good start. So-- so, what we're saying here is the reflection of the-- the individual that lives here is their work. You *are* what you *do.*

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel, you are what you do.

#### TREXEL

Yes you are, you know, what you produce in this life-- your--your output of, y'know, apart from anything else, really reflects who you are as a person, and your-- and your quality, so you really want to make sure that at the end of your life when you look back at all the things that you've done and made and--

#### DAVID

Hypothetically, planets that you've built.

#### TREXEL

--Hypothetically planets that you've built, really reflect who you are, and I think that's something that-- Oh, God I just had a little bit of a think about that. That's depressing, isn't it? That's gonna be a cavalcade of failure for me, isn't it? [__DAVID:__ Or! Or!] What have I done with my life? Oh, I'm spiralling.

#### DAVID

No! No, Trexel! Trexel! Trexel, no!

##### [stuttering incomprehensibly]

__TREXEL__: David, I'm spiralling!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning: Consultant spiralling.

__DAVID__: The--Th--Th--The Grand Atrium!What's the pod look like? Is it a big winter lettuce? What on Earth does a winter lettuce look like?

__TREXEL__: Well, you know a lettuce? No, of course you won't.

__DAVID__: No, I've never seen one.

#### TREXEL

Right, um-- How far back-- I don't know how-- how many fundamentals you were given when you were created.

#### DAVID

Okay, I theoretically know what a lettuce is. [__TREXEL:__ Okay, okay.] And I also theoretically know what a winter is. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Those two together? Not a clue.

#### TREXEL

Really cold lettuce.

#### DAVID

Really cold lettuce?

#### TREXEL

Like a block of ice! I'll give you-- for example, if you were going to murder someone with a lettuce, and then incidentally that's how one of them died. A lettuce just hit them right in the face and it-- it destroyed their brainstem, but if you imagine a lettuce, and it's been frozen solid, inedible? That's a winter lettuce.

#### DAVID

Okay so, um, that theoretical lettuce? [__TREXEL:__ Yep] That but hard. Still, don't know what the theoretical lettuce looks like.

#### TREXEL

Oh! Do you know leaves? [__DAVID:__ ...Yes.] Well, just like lots of leaves all just piled into a big ball...

#### DAVID

So sort of like a bush. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Yeah like a really-- really dense bush.

#### DAVID

A really dense bush, okay. Well, what if we made the pod look like a really dense bush!

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

And you peel back on of the outer leaves and that's how you get in. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Although, having a think about that-- Oh my god that'd be fantastic, because I just thought, if you did that, the way a lettuce works is the outer leaves-- there's like two or three covering the whole of the outside [__DAVID:__ Oh.] so if you have to open one, you just open the whole side There's like *thousands*and thousands of metres, just all opening up as you pull away one leaf door exposing the Grand Atrium to the outside elements. You're in a-- you're in a space, uh, suit! You're floating in there through, and then you close it, and then the air hisses back in-- That would mean we'd lose that thing around the door that I really like, you know when you put your foot around the door and then gravity kicks in and then-- and then it swings round--

#### DAVID

Oh! What if you did that and then there was a-- you had the big door __[TREXEL:__ Yes.] and then there was a second smaller door __TREXEL, excitedly:__ Yes.] that you then do the foot thing.

#### TREXEL

Just sort of hanging, just, sort of in the gap there, so that you can just sort of float up to that doorJust hanging, just, sort of in the gap there, so that you can just sort of float up to that door, engage some gravity, flip around the door, close it back up, and then you're inside. [__DAVID:__ Yeah, sure.] Y'know this is for a rich person. [__DAVID:__ We wanted to give them options.] We want them to have frivolity. [__DAVID:__ Yes] And you know, we want to distract them-- or remind them of all the murders they did or didn't do!

#### DAVID

Yes, when you're speaking of frivolity was-- what is the lead singer, as suspicious and mysterious as they are, did they-- do we know anything that they have done? Are they frivolous? Or--Or--Or are they, um, very stoic and, uh, and ascetic?

#### TREXEL

Well, let's have a little look at their credit card details, shall we.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Client financial records.

#### TREXEL

Okay, they make a lot of purchases of ruched fabrics. [__DAVID:__ Right.] That's a decadent fabric, David. [__DAVID__: Ah.] So we've got ruched fabric that's for, like-- for maybe a frilly jacket, or perhaps if you have a shirt and it has all these plumes just under the neck. __[DAVID:__ I don't. Is there anything else?] Dogs. They've purchased lots of dogs. [__DAVID:__ So--] Small dogs.

__DAV____ID:__ Dogs in frilly shirts.

#### TREXEL

David, I don't know what they do with it; I'm just going down a list.

#### DAVID

I was saying *we* could make dogs in frilly shirts.

#### TREXEL

We *could* make dogs in frilly shirts.

#### DAVID

What's the third thing?

#### TREXEL

The third thing, um, is...knives!

#### DAVID

Dogs in frilly shirts...with knives?

#### TREXEL

I mean, how would you get it to pick up the knife? Dogs are lovely!

#### DAVID

Cellotape it to its head.

#### TREXEL [shocked stuttering]

David! Are you a monster? Cellotape a knife to a dog's h-- to do what? Do you realize how terrible? The dog would be like, "Oh hello, friend! Hello lovely friend! I'm going to come and say hello. Guess what? I've got a knife tied to my head but I'm a dog so I don't have any concept of what that might mean." And then you jump up and you're stabbing your owner __[DAVID__: What does that--] in the neck and face!

#### DAVID

Well this is why I'm saying, d--does the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective, um, like a little bit of danger? I mea, if they did all of those murders they probably did, because they did all of those murders, so maybe they want to have some pets which engage in little, li-light knifeplay.

#### TREXEL

On the other hand, as we're building in options, they might not have, so again I'll-- David, we need to go for options. Half the dogs.

#### DAVID

Okay, half the dogs. Half the dogs.

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

Half the do-- No, half *of* the dogs. We're not King Solomon! You're not halving dogs, so you'll have two sides of a dead dog, and we'll say, "Well, there's your choice! Choose two sides of this dead--" That's no choice, David! That's a false choice! What I'm saying is you put a knife on half of the dog's head, __[DAVID:__ Okay.] and then you've got different call signals, so you've got a choice. Uh, you--you--you--you have options for the calls. You say, "Here, Knifey!" And all the dogs with knives, they all go round you up with knives, but if you don't like that? "Here, Friendly!" And then lovely dogs come up, and you've got options. And then, obviously, if you wish to go for one of the other, you should herd the half of the dogs that you don't like into the room that you're gonna explode, and then KABOOM!  Dogs gone.

#### DAVID

Right! Okay, um, and if you wanted the mix? Like, Knifey-Friendly? Friendly-Knifey? Ooh. Will the dogs maybe end up fighting one another?

__TREXEL solemnly:__ Very probably. Very probably. [__David hums]__ Dogs left on their own, and I know this from experience, and a small apartment and a lack of morals, the dogs left alone on their own for too long will just fight each other.

#### DAVID

Okay. So we're gonna have to have some sort of system in place to make sure the dogs don't just fight each other and kill each other *before* the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective get there.

#### TREXEL

They're sedated.

#### DAVID

Ah! And, actually as we all know, lead singers love drugs!

#### TREXEL

They love drugs!

#### DAVID

Love drugs!

#### TREXEL

All of them!

#### DAVID

So give them sedatives, give the dogs sedatives, give the dessert sedatives, [__TREXEL:__ Everybody's got sedatives.] give the lead singer sedatives.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Wonderful stuff. Lovely. David, David, I've just realized something: We've absolutely reflected and given them options to reflect this individual's personal state. But we've made a pod. We've made it focus inside. We need a sky.

__DAVID, shocked:__ The mood ring!

#### TREXEL

The mood ring in the sky-- How-- The m-- The sky has to be a mood-- We've-- We've made it internal! [__DAVID:__ Ah--!] Can you have a sky inside? [__DAVID:__ Well--] Inside sky?

#### DAVID

Yes, inside sky. You can have the Grand Atrium as so big and you said all of their work is so much, it goes off into the clouds. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, I see!] Into the c-- Into-- Into the artificial clouds, and we can have, like, a laser show, which if they're feeling particular things [__TREXEL__: Yes.] like murderous, [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hm.] or sad because of those accidents that happened, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] or sad because they blew up some of the dogs, or murderous because they blew up some of the dogs or--

#### TREXEL

Or just happy because there's dogs.

#### DAVID

Yeah, maybe! Or sad because there's knife dogs, um, then we can have a laser show that reflects that and reflects-- refracts off of the clouds!

#### TREXEL

But, David, the emotions of an individual are so complicated. How are we going to be able to read them from an individual and then reflect that in some sort of algorithm to lasers in the sky reflecting their mood? How? How, David, how!? How! How!

#### DAVID

A complex and detailed questionnaire every time they enter the building.

#### TREXEL

##### [stuttering]

Moment after moment, questions after que-- You make a cup of tea, or a drink, uh, and then it says, "How'd you feel about that? Here's 20 questions about that." [__DAVID:__ Exactly!] Then you sit down and they go, "How was that chair? How does that chair make you feel?"

#### DAVID

You've seen that dog get knifed; How does that make you feel?

#### TREXEL

Happy? Sad? Excited? Other? You know, and then at-- at any given point the lasers know that based on the weighting of the questions, what you need to be reflected in the sky. Excellent, David! I don't think that'll be massively annoying at all!

#### DAVID

No,no, probably not! I mean, I imagine that lead singers are quite introspective [__Trexel hums]__ and want to examine their feelings and thoughts quite a lot given the beauty of their lyrics, so maybe that sort of questionnaire would help crystallize that sort of emotion into, let's say, a sky that's a colour.

#### TREXEL

Tell you what, David: let's frame this. Let's pretend it's an interview for some sort of magazine. It's not a questionnaire you just have somebody in there full time saying that they're from some sort of, you know, uh, intergalactic, uh, uh, uh, a style and glamour magazine and they're just really interested to find out, you know, what are the real yous like. [__DAVID__: Yeah.] And then that makes it a fun thing, 'cause lead singers, they love to talk about themselves!

#### DAVID

Yes, w-- we-- well, we could, actually-- Maybe we could actually stream it! Create a publication that's all about, y'know, when the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] gets in the pod they can answer these questions and broadcast their thoughts out to the universe!

#### TREXEL

You could have their fanbase sign up to notifications, y'know, the lead singer of The Winter Lettuce Collective is feeling hungry or sad or introspective or murderous--

#### DAVID [gasps]

##### [Trexel gasps]

It could be a subscription service which would help pay for all the dogs that get killed!

#### TREXEL [exclaims]

##### [higher pitched voice]

It can pay for the dogs that get killed! And maybe some other things as well, but probably mainly for all of the dog upkeep! __[DAVID:__ Yeah!] Wonderful stuff! David, you're really nailing this sort of, like, double-edged marketing plus service, you know, you wrap it into one big thing and then when the customer at it they're like  "Do you make some money off that?" And you're like, "No don't look at that! Look at these dogs with knives! And yes, we make money!"

#### DAVID

Well, there's the thing: We're not making planets as products; we're trying to make planets as a *service*.

##### [beat]

#### TREXEL [threateningly]

David, if... If you start... If you start spewing consultancy stuff to *me...*[__DAVID:__ I-- I--] To Trexel Geistman, King Consultant, Big Boy, Big Boss, Consulting Boss, Daddy with the Consulting Stick, things won't go well for you, David. This is my patch. And you're living on my patch rent free. But if you start to trim *my* grass? And tell me that* my* hedges need looking at? Then I'll turn round to *you* and say, "Get off my lawn!"

#### DAVID [slightly scared]

##### [Trexel stutters over him]

##### [Trexel stutters over him]

Okay! Tell you what. Trexel! So, going forward? I--I--I--I mean, in the future...  ... I mean...Yes?!

#### TREXEL

##### [IMOGEN: [beep]

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Thank you!That's all I ever wanted from you, David, was just total and utter compliance. Well, y'know what, David? I think-- I think this planet-- I think this planet, this pod planet, is pretty good. I think it's pretty good. I thi-- I think Hartro's gonna like this one. It reflects all the things we needed in the brief, it contains a lot of dogs that murder each other, and saying that outloud that sounds bad now, but we've run out of time. Submit it! [__DAVID:__ Oh! Oh-- I, uh--] Would you like to submit?] Submit it! Submit it! Submit it! [__IMOGEN:__ Submitting!] There we go. Isn't that good? Job well done. And you said we needed more time! We absolutely nailed that one possibly maybe probably not! We'll find out tomorrow.

#### DAVID

So are you gonna turn up on time to the review?

#### TREXEL

Ah...I probably should.

#### DAVID

It would reflect well on both of us if you did. [__TREXEL:__ It would.] And you said yourself, it's very important.

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling over David]

##### [door swooshes closed] [David sighs defeatedly]

It's incredibly important, David, y'know fo-- for-- for my continued success and I suppose also for your continued existence it-- it-- it's...it's incredibly important. So, I'll... what about 2:00 I'll see how I feel, and, uh, we'll see you when I see you. [__DAVID: [slightly panicked]__ But it starts at 9:00!] Okay and have a lovely time! Okay, see you tomorrow and bye!!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Air purification system shutting down.

#### DAVID [talking quietly to himself]

Okay. I need to keep myself busy. Yes. That's it! If I have something to do while he's gone, maybe this crushing *fear* will go away! Yes. Yes! Um, le-- let's have a look.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Imogen online. How can I help you, [__DAVID: [recorded]__ Um... David 7?]?

#### DAVID

We-- We-- Well-- Well, uh, uh, I suppose, um, looking for a way to, um, keep myself busy-- to take my mind off of things.
