##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [fade into peaceful music, birds chirping. IMOGEN is acting as a therapist.]

#### IMOGEN [soothingly]

Remember, turn your reactive thoughts into reflective thoughts. Let "he's trying to kill me" become "he's trying to help me".

#### DAVID

He's trying to help me...

#### IMOGEN

Keep yourself from engaging in unhelpful anger. Try to strive for empathy and grace.

#### DAVID [takes a deep breath]

Empathy and grace...

#### IMOGEN

I will send you an invoice after this session.

#### DAVID

##### [deep breath]

Invoice... after session. Ahh...

##### [footsteps, door swooshes open, then Trexel enters. David yelps.]

#### TREXEL [sings]

##### [David sighs]

♪ What's? That? On the horizon? It's time... for sales!  Who's? That? Man over there? It's the king of sales! And I feel that he has the power to take us on a journey, but never fails! Lalalalalala, dancing girls and dancing boys-- ♫

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ Trexel! Trexel!

#### TREXEL

♪ Dancing with their dancing toys! Because-- ♫

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ Trexel!

#### TREXEL

♪ --sales is on, and sales is high-- ♫

#### DAVID

We don't have time for a full number!

#### TREXEL

♪ --and it is time for sales-y time! And sale will win the sale-y thing, [__DAVID:__ T-Trexel!] and the thing will swim in the lake of thing-- ♫

#### DAVID

TREXEL!

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

♪ And the time is happening now! ♫ *SALES TIME!*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Even longer than fear.

#### TREXEL

David, it's sales time!

#### DAVID [very frazzled]

Yes, it's time for sales...

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

Welcome to the sales quadrant! Trexel "Sales" Geistman presiding.

#### DAVID

Okay...

#### TREXEL

Don't you feel it in the air, David? [__DAVID:__ Um...] Don't you feel it in your bones? This, this is the *true* art. None of that design consultationwaffle! This is sales, pure commerce! Coursing, flowing out of my hands and eyes!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Please clean any excess 'commerce' from the floors before departure.

#### DAVID

Right, well, it feels so very different...

#### TREXEL

And you!

#### DAVID '

Cause a brief dropped about... seven hours ago.

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

Oh. What time is it?

#### DAVID [blathers]

You know... uh... roughly 20 minutes before the shift ends, give or take...

#### TREXEL

You know what, I left the Astral Bar *well* early! *Really* early! Like, super early!

#### DAVID

Mmhm. And when was that?

#### TREXEL

##### [trails off into silence]

I couldn't possibly say. I'm going to say... that it was an *amount* of time...

#### DAVID

Ah. Well... there is still a brief... that we need to read. So shall I get the brief-- is that sales-y enough?

#### TREXEL

##### [cheerful jingle]

It's part of sales, David. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Because you are an inductee into the Trexel Geistman Ten Steps to Ultimate Sales Domination Program!  Congratulations. [__DAVID:__ Yes. Right.] Now, the uniforms are intensely expensive, but you *will* have to order them in order to induct yourself into the course!

#### DAVID

I'm pretty sure I need to u--

#### TREXEL

Here's a catalogue!

#### DAVID

No, I need to wear this--

#### TREXEL

It is *not* written on a napkin!

#### DAVID

Okay, I am a Stellar Firma employee, and have to wear the mandated Stellar Firma uniform, otherwise, *gun walls!*

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hooray for gun walls!

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, what about if I was to draw with a pen on your forehead?

#### DAVID

We don't have ti-- what-- what are you gonna draw?

#### TREXEL

##### [begins trying to draw on David's forehead]

Okay, hang on a minute...

#### DAVID

No, I didn't-- No, I want to know what-- augh, stop it! __[slaps__ __Trexel's____ hands away]__

#### TREXEL

I-I'm just going to write "property of Trexel Geistman"!

#### DAVID [deeply appalled]

*No!*

#### TREXEL

*What?*

#### DAVID

Well, I'm *not!*

#### TREXEL

Well... I'm-- okay, fine. How about "property of Stellar Firma, brackets, but really Trexel, though"?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Watch it, buster!

#### DAVID

Nope, that's still not-- no. No. No!

#### TREXEL

Look, okay, *fine.* If you're not going to come along with me in this, and properly induct yourself into the sales program, then maybe you don't want to be a sales professional. Maybe there's-- maybe I'll abandon you to your fate.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

W--  Oh, my fate of not getting a brief done?

#### TREXEL

Uh, your fate of not getting *anything* done, walking into that sales room, making a *fool* of yourself in front of the client, and then being *recycled.* Is that what you want, David? Is that what you want?

#### DAVID [sighs, resigned]

No.

#### TREXEL

What's your option?

##### [long pause]

#### DAVID [resigned]

...you draw on my forehead.

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel draws on David's forehead as David makes unhappy sounds]

##### [scribbling]

##### [scribbling]

##### [scribbling]

##### [crumples up paper]

Okay...  Okey dokey. Now, I might've spelled my name wrong, but you know what, who else is gonna see? Well, me. And the client. But that's not important, they don't know how my name is spelled! Wait, do* I* know how my name is spelt? Okay, I'm just gonna write it down.  Just gonna write it down again.  Let's try that a third time. I've spelled it three different ways, David, and no one can say which is right. Oh well! It doesn't matter then.  So! Welcome. Welcome to the fold.

#### DAVID [flatly]

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now, unfold that piece of paper, because it *was* a piece of paper, and what's it say inside? It says success. Now, take that piece of paper, crunch it up into a ball.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Now eat that piece of paper.

#### DAVID [sighs]

I knew that...

#### TREXEL

Eat this piece of paper. Eat the piece of paper.

##### [with difficulty, David starts eating the paper]

#### TREXEL

Now chew it down. Swallow...

#### DAVID [muffled]

*Why's it taste like this??*

#### TREXEL

Just eat the paper.

##### [David swallows the paper with a 'bleh']

#### TREXEL

That paper... was made out of my discarded skin.

#### DAVID [loud sound of disgust]

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs]

Now you have a little piece of me inside of you,  which will be a seed, a *kernel,* of sales professionalism.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Biohazard detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Right. This is really...

#### TREXEL

Now it's time to begin.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But before we get started take this hat.

#### DAVID

Right... this is a small... fez.

#### TREXEL

##### [David puts hat on]

Put the hat on. What, you're just gonna do what you're told? [__DAVID:__ What--] Lesson one! [__DAVID:__ No--] Don't do what you're told. Now take the hat off.

#### DAVID

N-no.

#### TREXEL

David, take off the hat.

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

David, we can't continue unless you take the hat off!

#### DAVID [defiantly]

No!

#### TREXEL

Well, in that case, we can just sit here in silence.

##### [a solid 23 seconds of silence follows. Trexel mutters to himself, "Trexel Geistman", "rhombus rule", and "ham salad". David lets out a deeply exasperated 'mmm'.]

#### DAVID

Got about 15 minutes left...

#### TREXEL

Hm, sorry?

#### DAVID

Got about 15 minutes left--

#### TREXEL

Oh, so-- I thought I could hear someone who wanted to, uh, learn about sales, but apparently... they wouldn't take the hat off, so...

#### DAVID [sighs]

##### [takes off hat]

F-fine. Fine.

#### TREXEL

Lesson one failed *again*, David! Don't do what you're told!

#### DAVID [extremely angry noise]

#### TREXEL

Now, luckily, that's not the real lesson one. [__DAVID:__ *What?*] The *real* lesson one is determination.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Now, get the brief, and we'll get right into it.

#### DAVID [sighs]

Oh, right into it? Oh, lickety split!

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Right into it, David, there's no time to waste!

#### DAVID

Fine. Brief.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel hums]

##### [pause]

The client is Kaliah Tallett. Going by she/her.  She needs a planet built, uh... "I need a shrine to the mouse king, Mickolas. I would like it to have at least four deathly trials. Uh, and a ferris wheel, for the winners!" She... well, telling us about her likes and dislikes, "the almighty mouse king Mickolas, and mixed martial arts".  Not really any specification of which one is...

#### TREXEL

No, no, we'll get into it.

#### DAVID

Um, and, if she was an animal, what would she be? "A mouse, so that I could be a mouse concubine to the mouse king."

#### TREXEL

Hang on, are they a mouse already? Is she a mouse already or is she... what is she, if she wants to be a mouse?

#### DAVID

Not a mouse, I guess.

#### TREXEL

No-- not a mouse? Okay, fine. Not a mouse. Fine. Well, that's specific.

#### DAVID [stutters]

What is her greatest strength? Uh, her "unmatched loyalty to the Almighty." Which I'm gonna assume is Mickolas...

#### TREXEL

Could be.

#### DAVID

And what is her greatest weakness? "Nausea!" She starts retching when she's nervous.

#### TREXEL

Ahh, that's useful.

#### DAVID

Right, um, so... determination! Is helping us... in the following way. Trexel?

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Sorry, David, are you-- are you trying to lead this lesson?

#### DAVID

No, I was-- I'm asking--

#### TREXEL

Are you the teacher?

#### DAVID [pause]

Are *you* the teacher?

#### TREXEL

Determination is leading us to success in this way: determination is the *key* to successful sales. If you don't determine, you don't *returnin'*... the dividends.

#### DAVID ...

right.

#### TREXEL

What does that mean in practice?

#### DAVID

Uhhh...

#### TREXEL

Shouting.

#### DAVID

Wha--

#### TREXEL

If you're not shouting, then it ain't happening. [__DAVID:__ Right.] Because people respect a shouter. Now, I'm a shouter, David, I'm a shouter. And that has served me well over the years. Because it's easy to ignore someone that's quiet! That's why I ignore *most other people.* But a shouter, you can't get away from them! Your eardrums are bleeding, because they're yelling at you from an inch and a half away! Ooh, what's that they're saying? Through the blood, I can hear confidence. Determination equals shouting, and shouting equals confidence.

#### DAVID [flatly]

So your lesson is just we walk in there and shout at Kaliah Tallett.

#### TREXEL

It's not as *simple* as that, David, of course! You've gotta work out what you're shouting *about*! You can't just go, "*AAH! AAH! AAH!*" 'Cause people will think that there's, like, an airlock breach or something. You've gotta be shouting words.

#### DAVID

Right, so what words should we be shouting?

#### TREXEL

That's interesting. Let's dig into this planet that they're thinking of. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] So, we need to be shouting at them in a way that makes them think that the planet we're offering them fits what they want. Now, what was that-- the weaknesses, the weaknesses are important in this particular lesson.

#### DAVID

Right. Well, um... nausea. Uh, she starts retching when she's nervous.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so. You can--with the method of shouting--really, really put someone on edge. And if that's a weakness that they have, if they're gonna be like, "Ooh, ooh, I'm being shouted at, and I'm nervous because of all this confidence over there, in fact, I'm a little bit sick!" People agree to things whilst they're trying not to vomit in public!

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So-- you've really gotta browbeat them. So, let's just-- let's just, uh, take a scenario here. Um... you are, let's say, the teacher of a school.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

##### [sounds of schoolchildren and commotion in background]

#### DAVID

O-okay.

#### TREXEL

And in that school is just rowdy peoples.

#### DAVID

Rrh. Okay.

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Nervous. Nervous rowdy peoples.

#### DAVID

Oh. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Now, come into the room and try and get them to be quiet.

##### [long pause, chattering in background]

#### DAVID [shouting]

Right, you horrible lot! Shut up and vomit on me!

##### [background chattering turns to gasps]

#### TREXEL

You've been fired. [__DAVID:__ What?] You've been fired by the school board. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] You shouted at them and you insulted them. Now you've got to remember, David! Shouting isn't insulting!

#### DAVID

Okay?

#### TREXEL

They're different things! [__DAVID:__ Right.] The volume does not dictate the tone.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Let me try.

#### DAVID

##### [imitating rowdy schoolchild]

Right, um... Rah rah rah. Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy. Nervous, nervous, nervous.

#### TREXEL

##### [shouting, high-pitched]

*I'M TREXEL GEISTMAN AND I AM LORD AND I AM KING!*

##### [stock children cheering sound]

#### DAVID [quietly]

I pooed myself.

#### TREXEL

See? I didn't insult you, no one can write anything down into an accusing letter, and yet I've got their respect. I've got their attention. You see?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ Um... okay. I'll-- yes.

#### TREXEL

So, that brings us on to the content. The content of the shouting. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] So, they want a planet in which they can put people through trials? Am I-- Is that--

#### DAVID

Uh, yes. So, it needs to be a shrine to the mouse king Mickolas.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasps]

Oh, it's a shrine? Trial shrine! Trial by shrine! Now, this is an excellent way of, y'know-- if you have a religion, and I don't, but if you do have a religion-- maybe I should get a religion. Could I be a god?

##### [alarms buzz]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [large, threatening gun unfolds]

Alert! Idolatry detected.

#### TREXEL

Oh-- I am not a god. There is no power higher than the Board.

#### DAVID [flatly]

Yes.

##### [gun retracts]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

IMOGEN is the only god you need.

#### TREXEL

##### [quickly]

Okay, but-- if I was to be a... enshrined person below the Board but an enshrined person--

#### DAVID

Theoretically, hypothetically.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Watch it, buster!

#### TREXEL

Do you think people would give me stuff?

#### DAVID

Uh, just give you things?

#### TREXEL

Just give me things!

#### DAVID

Without you asking for them?

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

No?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Why not?!

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Well, because religions, the-the sort of... figures, the figureheads, they're always asking for things, right? No one just turns up and goes, "Oh, do you happen to be a god? Here, have my shoes! They're very nice." No, what you do is, you walk in and then somebody comes to you and says, "My god says I need your shoes!"

#### TREXEL

So it's like a, like a hostage situation? "I've got your eternal soul over here, and if you want it back, you've gotta give me some harvest!"

#### DAVID

I think so!

#### TREXEL

I can do that. I've done that loads! Just not in the context of being a god.

#### DAVID

Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

"If you want to see your wallet again, give me what's in your wallet!"

#### DAVID ["So let me get this straight" tone]

So we're gonna be Kaliah Tallett's god and-and demand a planet design.

#### TREXEL

##### [gasp]

Yes! Exactly! Exactly! David, you've got it, you've got it! Now, what's more shouty than a god? We'll walk in there, and we'll pretend to be...

#### DAVID

Mickolas?

#### TREXEL

We'll pretend to be Mickolas!

#### DAVID [done with this]

We're gonna pretend to be Mickolas.

#### TREXEL

We're gonna go in there and we're just gonna be like, "We are Mickolas! And you are building a shrine trial planet to us, and we shall dictate the terms, mortal. Puny mortal!"

#### IMOGEN [beep]

*All kinds* of blasphemy detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Right, because I'm guessing... this is sales, so we're gonna try and *up*sell--

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

--certain things, so maybe the ferris wheel needs to be made of...

#### TREXEL

Gold!

#### DAVID

No-- plutanium!

#### TREXEL

Oh! Okay, plutanium.

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Rarer than gold?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

More *dangerous* than gold...

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Mined from the inside of a black hole!

#### DAVID

Exactly. You just puttle in there with your little black hole mine-y thing-- I don't know how they do it, but they do it, and we have it.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

They do it at an enormous expense, [__DAVID:__ Exactly.] that is the main thing, that's the path to the upsell. David, you're actually-- I'm quite impressed, David.

#### DAVID

Oh,thank you!

#### TREXEL

You're already getting it. Now, this is of course due to *my* perfect 10-step program. We're one step in! And you're already improving. Which means *I...* am amazing. So--

#### DAVID

Well done, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

--we walk in there and we insist that we are their god. And we upsell them-- What's that ferris wheel made of? Gold? No-- plutanium! Even more, greater, expensive plutanium! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] What else is there?

#### DAVID

Um, um, ooh, uh, so they want deathly trials, and, uh, we have the ferris wheel, and the shrine. Like, the actual shrine.

#### TREXEL

Okay, now, these deathly trials, that's a lovely, *broad* brief. What's deathly to these people?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Could be anything.

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

But whatever it's gonna be... it's gonna be pricey.

#### DAVID

Well, they dislike-- they either dislike the mouse king Mickolas, or mixed martial arts. Or both. Or neither.

#### TREXEL

Now, it would be a bit weird if you were building a shrine, to your god, in order to put people through trials in order to *please* your god, if you didn't like them.

#### DAVID

Doesn't necessarily say to *please* the god.

#### TREXEL

Good point. Maybe their god's a fearful, vengeful god!

#### DAVID

Mm!

#### TREXEL

Ahh... you don't like your god, but it's the god you've got! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Sometimes you're just, you're just in a situation and whoever's in authority happens to be your god, and that's just-- and that's just life, unfortunately!

#### DAVID

Yeah, sort of trapped in a spiritual room with said god.

#### TREXEL

##### [missing the irony]

Exactly!

#### DAVID

##### [pause]

Ah. Mm. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Who could relate?

#### DAVID

In...deed.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Metaphysics detected! Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

So... okay, so the trial is trial by god.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You're in a-- you've got a trial shrine, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and the trial... is the subject of the shrine. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] So, we need to build a giant animatronic god-mouse to fight the trial people!

#### DAVID

##### [gasps]

Plutanium...  mouse... [__TREXEL:__  Yes!] guardians!

#### TREXEL

Plutanium mouse guardians, yes! Yes-- more than one, because maybe this god has many aspects! You have the Kindly Mouse of Health-Giving, and you have the Vengeful Mouse of War, and you have the wise old mouse who sold their right eye to a peddler man in order to gain wisdom!

#### DAVID

Yes! And is that what we know about Mickolas?

#### TREXEL

I've no idea! [__DAVID:__ Right.] But guess what? You're not gonna question a god! You're not gonna walk into a shrine and be like, "that's not my god", cause guess what? That's an [sic] god! And it will *god* you right into the floor!

#### DAVID

Right, so we've got to convince Kaliah that this is the Micko-- we are Mickolas, [__TREXEL:__  We are Mickolas!] and this is our religion.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

So what are our tenets?

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

Right, okay. Now this has got, this has got much broader but let's go--

#### DAVID

Ooh! Ooh! Which aspect-- okay, yeah, which aspect do I have to be? Can I wear a big hat? Can I be the War-Mouse?

#### TREXEL

We need to dress as giant mice!

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Okay, right. How are we going to get giant mouse costumes in the next six minutes so we can go in there and pretend to be giant mice?

#### DAVID

Uhhh... I have bedclothes, right! Uh, let's get the bed linen--

#### TREXEL

Yes, get the bedclothes, get the bedclothes!

#### DAVID

##### [toilet lid closes]

And there might be something in the toilet-- No, there's nothing   in the toilet. Uh, right! Um, so I'm just gonna put this round your head...

#### TREXEL

Okay, yep.

#### DAVID

And then just, like, maybe-- ooh! I could use the slurry as sort of a solder. Let's just-- okay, there we go--

##### [slurry hissing]

#### TREXEL

Ahh, ahh, ooh! That's hot, it's hot, it's hot. Now-- now give me a piece of, give me a piece of paper, and tear it in half, and those will be the front teeth.

#### DAVID

##### [paper tearing]

Okay, just let me--  there we go, right! Okay!

#### TREXEL

Now, do I look like a convincing mouse god, David? "Fear me! Fear me! Squeak!"

#### DAVID

...Well, if we shout it loud enough, then... yes!

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, I've just thought of something.

#### DAVID

What.

#### TREXEL

We've only got one bedsheet, and I'm wearing it! What are you gonna be?

#### DAVID

Uhhhh... your clone assistant.

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

What, you're just gonna be just what *you* are? I'm going to be an all-powerful mouse god, and you're going to be my clone assistant that's oddly similar to the clones at Stellar Firma?

#### DAVID

Okay, a clone... spiritual assistant.

#### TREXEL

##### [tosses off mouse clothing, David yelps]

David, you're, you're just scrambling around now. That's nothing. Get this-- get this stuff off me! Get it off me! Can't believe you got me swept up in your silly games, David!

#### DAVID [disappointed]

Oh.

#### TREXEL

No, the sensible option is to claim that the mouse god can shapeshift into the form of the consultants you hired!

#### DAVID

That's it. [__TREXEL:__  Yes!] Okay, fine. So we need tenets for this religion, and tenets which are gonna sell a lot of things to Kaliah Tallett.

#### TREXEL

Tenet one.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Spend, spend, spend! [__DAVID:__ Okay, right!] Our god is a profilate god and it loves when you spend money unreasonably!

#### DAVID

Great, but general! We need to give them sort of specifics. Let me have a look at the brief-- mixed martial arts, maybe all kicking has to be done with golden shins!

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes! And you have to pay the kicking tithe!

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ I want to kick, pay the kicking tithe! I want to stay alive, so I pay the big mouse god the kicking tithe! So I may live! ♫

#### DAVID

Yes, exactly that! Right, so kicking tithe. What else is here... uh, uh, nauseous! Every time you feel nauseous that's--

#### TREXEL

##### [David sings along]

♪ Pay the nauseous tithe! I want to stay alive, so I pay the naughting nauseous tithe-- ♫ Oh, and it all just fits into the same rhyme scheme, David!

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, okay, right! So they want to be a mouse concubine, so, so some kind of body transmogrification tithe!

#### TREXEL

♪ Body transmogrification tithe! I transmogrify to stay alive! To become a mouse! A mouse of my god, because I've got this hot mouse bod! ♫

#### IMOGEN [beep]

That's a stretch.

#### DAVID

Right, so, we've got the tenets for the religion, but we need to do something about the planet! We need--

#### TREXEL

Don't worry, David! Don't worry! Yes, yes-- if we have time, and if we have something to do on that, sure! We can talk about the planet. But when you've got an idea *this* strong... when you're going to go to somebody and say, "Guess what! Your religion is different from what you thought when you came in and actually now it involves paying us a *lot* of money," you don't need to *bother* with the planet! This is sales, my friend! Loopholes, loopholes!

#### DAVID

Right! And her greatest strength is her unmatched loyalty to the Almighty, so every time she questions us, we say, "Ooh! Ooh! Oooooooh! You're not very loyal, are you?"

#### TREXEL

Exactly! It's a foolproof system! It's a Catch-22, [__DAVID:__ Precisely.] I'm going to kill you!

#### DAVID

##### [loud knocks begin]

Right! Uh--  Aah! The knocking! The knocking on the door!

#### TREXEL

That means it's time, David.

#### DAVID

Right!

#### TREXEL

That means it's time to step through and face your sales fears.

#### DAVID

Okay... does anything-- does anything go into a tube?

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

Does anything go into a tube?

#### TREXEL

No! [__DAVID:__ No tubes?] No tube anymore, David. [__DAVID:__ What?] We walk through that door with paper in hand and we look our client in the eye, and we tell them *we are their new gods.*

#### DAVID

Right. Shouting. Okay, shouting.

#### TREXEL

Now remember, what have you learned? What have you learned, David, what have you learned?

#### DAVID

Shout-- shout, but don't insult? [__TREXEL:__  Shout but don't insult.] Um, and we are her god now!

#### TREXEL
