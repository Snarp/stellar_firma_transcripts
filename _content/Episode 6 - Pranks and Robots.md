#### ALEX

Hi, everyone, Alex here. I'd just like to take a moment to thank some of our patrons: Mariah Magee, Aviv, Kaitlin Porter, CHeshireSavant, Kevin Cantu, Michael Giese, Emily Hannigan, Anne Eilertsen, Greg McMullen, BjÃ¶rn JÃ¤ger. We really appreciate your support. If you'd like to join them, go to www.patreon.com/RustyQuill and take a look at our rewards.

#### BEN

Hi, I'm Ben, I play David 7.

#### TIM

Hi, I'm Tim, I play Trexel Geistman.

#### BEN

Um, we just wanted to say, we really appreciate the support that you've given us already. The response to the first couple of episodes has been fantastic.

#### TIM

It's been really really good and I've seen we've already some lovely, um, views and ratings on iTunes and various places, and that really is the best way of, uh, getting the podcast out there and sharing it outside the pocket universe of Rusty Quill. So please take a moment to give us a rating or review on iTunes or your podcast player of choice. It is incredibly helpful when you do.

#### BEN [in a low voice]

Just spread those glands.

#### TIM [forcefully]

Smell our musk!

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Stuart McQueen for today's submission! May solar radiation bleach your scales in readiness for spawning.

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [talking to himself]

Maybe I could make a knife. If I made a knife, I could...prise open the door, or rewire the light button... give David light.

#### TREXEL

♪ Trexel's a jolly good-- Yes, David, how are you doing? I am doing fantastic!

#### DAVID [sarcastically]

Why's that, Trexel? You are still extremely late for work.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

I. Have. Been. Up. Since. Our. Last. Meeting. Celebrating, David! We did so w-- Well, I did so well!Oh my, I feel honoured to allow you to work with me, David. I mean, my vision, my skill, and my mental acuity has allowed us to get the best review that I've ever had!

#### DAVID

Well, that's... great!

#### TREXEL

Isn't it though!

#### DAVID [choosing his words carefully]

Yeah, well, no, it's really good.

#### TREXEL

I could have done it without you, but I didn't, you were there.

#### DAVID

Well...

#### TREXEL

Thank you, David.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Thank you for sticking by me through all of my threats and being late. Obviously now we understand that's all part of the process, David, that's all part of my genius! I know you doubted me, David, but you shouldn't have, because you're an idiot! So what I'm saying is, well done, me.

#### DAVID

Yes. So. Well done, you, as the seventh clone and apparently the only one to have lasted more than a week.

#### BOTH [singing disjointedly]

##### [David sighs]

You didn't--Do it again.

#### BOTH ♪

For he's a jolly good fe-ellow! And Trexel is the best. ♫

#### TREXEL

I am! Trexel is the best!

#### DAVID [hurriedly]

So thank you for arriving before the day ended.

#### TREXEL

Good 20-25 minutes before the day ended.

#### DAVID

Didn't wanna break our streak of a perfect 4. Let's make it a perfect 5, so I'm gonna--

#### TREXEL

Let's make it a perfect 6, and then 7, and then who knows, David, who knows!

#### DAVID

Maybe even 8! Yes!

#### TREXEL

Yes! Could be. 9?

#### DAVID

Could be 8! 10...

#### TREXEL

Well, let's not dare to dream.

#### DAVID

I will dare to dream because my life depends on it. Anyway, would you like to turn the light on Trexel?

#### TREXEL

But I thought it gave a certain sexy mystique to the room.

#### DAVID

I can't see the button to get the thing.

#### TREXEL

Alright, I'll turn on the lights!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### TREXEL

There we go.

#### DAVID

Thank you.

#### TREXEL

Are you happy now? Are you happy now the feng shui is gone? I'm gonna level with you, David, I've had a drink or two.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Drunkenness logged.

#### TREXEL

Or four... Or at this stage, it's been 2 days since I last saw you, so you can assume lots of drinks.

#### DAVID

It's been 3 days, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

3 days!? Wow, one of those days really got away from me then.

#### DAVID

Yep.

#### TREXEL

Good. Party.

#### DAVID

Good! Well, I'm glad you've had fun.

#### TREXEL

I have! What's on the brief?

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel hums]

So we have a requirement from Megatron_46.Uh, they are asking for a planet dedicated to the consumption of rare delicacies, and their non-negotiable feature is the native species of the planet must be unfeasibly aggressive in everything they do.

#### TREXEL

Yes... yes. Yes, this makes sense. This makes sense! I thought this one would come back to bite us eventually.

#### DAVID

...Really?

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

So, you've had history with Megatron_46?

#### TREXEL

Not me personally, but, uh, yes, Stellar Firma Ltd. and humankind have had a bit of a history with the Megatrons, yeah...

#### DAVID

The Megatrons. So this is the 46th of the Megatrons?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, I--I think...I think the issue started when we allowed them to build themselves. Magatron_1? Lovely robot, excellent robot, really helpful, really hopeful. Megatron_2? Bit more violent, bit more weapon-y, you know how it is. Military industrial complex gets their little hands in there. "Give it a gun! Let it protect us! Oh, why don't we make it more smart? Here comes Megatron_3, he'll do lots of maths and such." Then it kind of spiralled out of control. Megatron_4 controlled things with its mind, Megatron_5 could make other Megatrons, and then they just, sort of, moved on without us and, um, they have their own society now! Occasionally they'll threaten war, but thus far, mainly they're customers!

#### DAVID

Right so, how many of them are there? Is this-- Is this the 46th in the line of, like, Megatron Primes? Or is this, like, the 46th ever Megatron, so they, like, they built themselves, but then decided to make, like, 30.

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

Oh! No, no, this is the 46th ever, but they do have an essentially indefinite lifespan, so they at this stage I don't know how many they've--

#### DAVID

So there's just just 46 of them running around?

#### TREXEL

Oh there's-- there's many more than 46. It just happens that 46 has given us a call and asked for a planet.

#### DAVID [hums in realization]

Ooh! So this is not the last Megatron, it's just one of the Megatrons.

#### TREXEL

No! Ohoh, there are lots and we don't know where they all are.

#### DAVID

Well, since Megatron_46 has talked to us, do we know anything about Mega-- the 46th Megatron?

#### TREXEL

They. Hate. Humans. Oh gosh, they hate humans!

#### DAVID

Do they like to eat humans?

#### TREXEL

No, they're robots, David.

#### DAVID

Well, I mean, yes, but they--

#### TREXEL

Robots don't eat humans.

#### DAVID

But they've asked--

#### TREXEL

Robots eat carbon.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay, so they've-- they've asked for the consumption of rare delicacies. So from their point of view then, are we just going to have lots of interesting carbon strains? Or are they thinking in more -- in a sort of, commercial sense?

#### TREXEL

##### [David hums]

It's a good question; We don't know if this planet is for entertaining. They love to organize groups of people against the humans. They invite them 'round, they give them dinners, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] they introduce them to dangerous animals-- Who knows! They're so inscrutable. I think it's because we didn't give them faces with expressions.  Just a big plate... A big plate with a face drawn on.

#### DAVID

Right. In, sort of, marker pen.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, yes.

#### DAVID [under his breath]

Well, fair enough.

#### TREXEL

Early technology.

#### DAVID

Do we know the expression that exists on Megatron_46's face?

#### TREXEL

Let me hang-- Hang on, shall I get the manual?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Hang on let's have a look.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Megatron fact file.

##### [Trexel counting under his breath]

#### TREXEL

There we are! 46!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Known images.

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Sort of coy!

#### DAVID

Okay?

#### TREXEL

##### [David hums in approval]

Sort of a coy, wry smile. Like, you co-- you could maybe mistake it for a frown, but you know, there's humour there in the eyes.

#### DAVID

Okay, so a bit of a cheeky Megatron.

#### TREXEL

##### [inhales]

##### [gasp]

Like, a cheeky--  Maybe it's a-- Maybe-- David! Prank planet.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Pranks detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

Prank planet.

#### DAVID

What's a prank planet?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs victoriously]

A prank planet! Like, have you ever heard of a... of a spike planet? It's when you build a planet just to really irritate the planets nearby. A prank planet is like that, but its a planet that you make look nice, and then people come along, and then people get on there and all sorts of terrible things happen to them, and then you jump out from behind a tree--

#### DAVID

Wh-- But, Trexel, they haven't asked for a prank planet. [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] They've asked for a--

#### TREXEL

But David, don't you see? I'm a genius, so if I've thought it, then that's what they really want!

#### DAVID

But wouldn't they just want you to follow the brief?

#### TREXEL

I approach planet-building holistically, David. Do you know what holistically means? Of course, you don't. Holistically means: Shut up and listen to me. I think therefore I am. I do therefore I am. So what I'm trying to say is what the brief tells my brain to do must be the right thing to do, because I cannot be wrong! I think our review proved nothing if not that, David.

#### DAVID [monotonously]

Right.

#### TREXEL

Prank planet.

#### DAVID

Prank planet.

#### TREXEL

Prank planet.

#### DAVID [sarcastically]

What a good idea. Right, well the prank plant then. What should the pranks be? Should they--

#### TREXEL [tripping over his words]

Well, there's two elements again. Tell me the two elements.

#### DAVID

Yes. They wanted the consumption of rare delicacies, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] and the native species of the planet must be unfeasibly aggressive in everything they do.

#### TREXEL

Yes. The prank's built-in, David. The prank's built-in.

#### DAVID

...Right.

#### TREXEL

We need-- now I know we've done a trough moon. Loved the trough moon. Loved it.

#### DAVID [unsure]

...Yes. Hartro seemed really taken with the trough moon.

#### TREXEL

I know they had to change it to make it something else, but the trough moon was great, and I think we should be experimenting with shapes. If we're just gonna put a big dinner table on a ball, that's so last day, you know? You know? That's like a day that's gone. So why don't we try-- Throw some shapes at me, David. What shapes could we use?

#### DAVID

Rhombus.

#### TREXEL

Rhombus.

#### DAVID

Parallelogram.

#### TREXEL

Parallelogram.

#### DAVID

Ball.

#### TREXEL

Ball.

#### DAVID

Small ball.

#### TREXEL

Small ball?

#### DAVID

Big ball.

#### TREXEL

Okay, these are variations on ball, David, I think pretty sure we're not gonna do ball!

#### DAVID

We're not gonna-- We're definitely not gonna do ball.

#### TREXEL

That's for the hacks, David!

#### DAVID

Any iteration of a ball?

#### TREXEL

How thin do you think we could go?

#### DAVID

A thin ball.

#### TREXEL

Like a-- Like a-- No, not a ball! Not a ball, David, but a ball-- Like a-- Like a plank... like a thin plank of a planet.

#### DAVID

So a table.

#### TREXEL

##### [David tries to interject]

Maybe-- Yes! Yes! Oh! David, the planet is the surface of the table, and each moon is a chair, and we have them all in a very delicate balance, so the table planet orbits around the nearest star, but all of the moons are just in stasis, and they hold their positions, uh, uh, a due stationary position around them, and you sit on a tiny little moon, and then you put your hands-- But those hands? They're on the surface of the planet, David! And thus... How're we gonna have animals on that? How are we gonna have animals on that, David?  If the planet is a surface and that's the tabletop, where are the animals gonna live? This is ridiculous, David! This is ridiculous. Is this one of your ideas, David?

#### DAVID [giving up]

I...Yes, Trexel, obviously. What if you throw something at me? What about something-- I-- I mean-- Let's really, um, reshape the wheel. You've been doing a lot of... uh... weird... shapes, so what if we go back to-- to the ball! Wh-- What if, you know--

#### TREXEL

Simple. Classic. Almost so classic it's unexpected and therefore originally new again-- David, shut up, I've got an incredible idea!

#### DAVID [with

__infinite____ patience]__ What is it, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Let's do a ball.

#### DAVID [feigning surprise]

Ooh, really?

#### TREXEL

People will think, "What's Geistman gonna do? Surely he's gonna go with some sort of crazy shape." And then they turn around and they-- they take off the blanket that they've laid over the planet, and they go, "Wow!--"

#### DAVID

A ball.

#### TREXEL

"--He's really gone back to basics with this ball."

#### DAVID

Ball classic.

#### TREXEL

Ball classic. Right okay, what size of ball?

#### DAVID

Well, what size are a Megatron?

#### TREXEL

As the name would suggest, pretty big.

#### DAVID

A mega.

#### TREXEL [quietly]

A mega.

#### DAVID

Kinda big. Okay, well quite a big planet then, maybe. Uh, also, you mentioned that Megatron maybe wants to court species that don't like humans.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hm, Mm-hm. Sure, sure.

#### DAVID

Uh, what are the species that don't like humans?

#### TREXEL

Most of them. Most of them.

#### DAVID

Most of them.

#### TREXEL

We're pretty useful. They like our terraforming technology and the-- and the-- they like the fact that we provide fancy, fancy goods, but as a species, not well-liked.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

I think it's because we destroyed our own planet through hubris, and other people are like, "Mmm if you destroyed your planet through hubris, how are you going to build a good planet for me?" and we say, "Shut up!"

#### DAVID

Sure! Well, seems very successful, so that seems to be working. Right, well what is the average size of all the species in the universe? If that is in fact the clientele for people who hate humans.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Clarify.

#### TREXEL

So if the sample size for things that humans is everyone, what's the precise average of everyone?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [pause]

Calculating.  Results.

#### TREXEL

##### [David hums]

Well, you've got your megafauna and your minifauna,  then you've got your gas. Now gas can change side, and there are--

#### DAVID

Wait, so gas hates us?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs lightly]

##### [baby-talk]

Oh, there are plenty of gas beings that really hate us, David. I-- I-- I cannot even begin to tell you how manygaseous bodies really want us to-- really want us to fly into a black star, so maybe-- Ooh! Ooh! Maybe we have a descending scale. So we have a giant place setting, but the table itself starts off enormous-- a mile wide, chairs as big as mountains, and then as you move around the planet, they become smaller and smaller until there's a tiny little chair on the  end of a tiny little table so germs can sit there and they can eat a little bit of food. Yum yum yum.

#### DAVID

Okay, so there's sort of, uh, spine around the planet--

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

--which is the dinner table!

#### TREXEL

A dinner spine.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel agrees]

Okay, um, maybe stretch it from pole to pole? And then around the equator are the larder of the planet which holds all of these delicacies.

#### TREXEL

##### [David agrees]

##### [David agrees]

Yes, you've got to keep them somewhere, and delicacies change for different species!  A delicacy for some gas is not the same as a delicacy for a germ. So we're gonna need big larders.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Massive planet.

#### DAVID

Yes, planet-sized larders. So, we need something to make those animals aggressive, because obviously we need, you know, we need a stock for the delicacies. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] It makes sense that the delicacies are the animals and those animals are aggressive.

#### TREXEL

You won't have to-- You don't want to have to go out to the shops mid-- mid schmooze.

#### DAVID

Exactly.

#### TREXEL

So let's make the wh-- whole planet-- the whole rest of the planet the larder in which those delicacies are contained. But those delicacies need to be furious!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Furious delicacies!

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

##### [Trexel hums]

Yes, exactly. Some of th--th--the universal, or galactic delicacies that exist. I mean, I've actually never eaten anything that comes out of a tube so I don't really know!

#### TREXEL

Aah. Quintessent jelly.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

That's the pinnacle of what I know. It--It's--It's a floating orb of shimmering gel. I don't know what it's from, but it tastes like sunshine simulated through a-- through a star shield. It-- It tastes like the first hug on a wet morning. It tastes like the smell of hot, baking matter fresh out of Daddy's oven.

#### DAVID

...Right. So, if that came from a thing, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] What would make that thing angry?

#### TREXEL

##### [abrupt and emotional]

What would make it angry? If that-- if that beautiful jelly came from an animal, what would make that animal cross. Slamming doors. Shouting from other rooms-- you don't know what they're saying, but you know it's about you. It's your fault, Trexel! It's your fault that they're cross!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning: consultant spiraling.

#### TREXEL [loud and hoarse]

That's why they left each other. That's why Mommy and Daddy got divorced because you were a bad boy. A bad boy, Trexel!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sadness detected. Security alerted.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

...right. So maybe just some slamming doors and some arguments then. Some nice, generic arguments.

#### TREXEL

##### [David agreeing]

Yes. Really-- Really alienate an animal as a child and then it'll make delicious jelly. I think that's what I'm saying.

#### DAVID [taken aback]

Right. Okay! Well, you're the expert!

#### TREXEL

So we need to emotionally alienate all the-- Yes, because true anger comes from within. Have you found this, David? Have you found this?

#### DAVID

You know what? Yes.

#### TREXEL

All of your problems truly, all of the most angering problems really, they come from within. So to make animals cross all the time regardless of what else is happening, you need to really make them angry at source.

#### DAVID

Right. So we need to raise all these animals in really emotionally distant ways.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Make them codependent on other entities that are not healthy for them, and then take those entities away. Really just emotionally traumatize a load of animals, and then release them onto a planet to be later eaten by intergalactic guests.

#### DAVID

Well, what if we could make the planet emotionally traumatize them actively, so when they're bred--

#### TREXEL

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! A psychic shield!

#### DAVID

Right!

#### TREXEL

A psychic shield! Have you ha--ha--had a psychic shield?

#### DAVID [deadpan]

I've been in this room for the last week and two days.

#### TREXEL

Of course, of course, of course, of course. But have you, um, seen a psychic shield?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay well, a psychic shield-- It is a-- a plane, like a plane of light, and as you go through it, it just scrambles your mind. In any way you want!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Maybe it'll make you stop smoking. Maybe it'll make you, you know, enjoy ginger. Or maybe it will emotionally traumatize you in a massive way.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Whatever you put the setting at. Those are the three main settings.

#### DAVID

Okay so, what was it again? Ginger, [__TREXEL:__ Ginger.] emotional trauma, [__TREXEL:__ Or stop smoking.] or stop smoking.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You can make it do other things, but those are the three presets.

#### DAVID

Right so, I think we're probably gonna have to deal with the, uh, the-- the third preset, which is--

#### TREXEL

Well, it's nice that it's there.

#### DAVID

--emotional trauma.

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### DAVID

Right so, what you're saying is maybe we have this dinner table spine.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

That's safe because it's not good--

#### TREXEL

That's a safe one.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel grunts]

It's not good to emotionally traumatize your guests over dinner. [__TREXEL:__ No!] Got a nice starport,  which just ferries them down and lands them on whatever size is appropriate. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Um--

#### TREXEL

Maybe there's some sort of, like, funnelling system, and as the funnel becomes too narrow that's when it goes "Oop! You're too big now!" And it plops ya down.

#### DAVID

Yeah, and then maybe we need some sort of communication system, because of course if-- if-- if Megatron's really big, and they're entertaining something that's really small, well they've got to go to the small seats, which could be on the other side of the planet, so you need to-- you have to sort of ring up and maybe have a call-- some sort of video call.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, I co-- it could be intercom pointed at all points of the table so that everybody can speak to everyone else, but if there's somebody there that you don't like, you can ignore them.

#### DAVID

Right. So it's like a gigantic conference table?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

And, uh, then--

#### TREXEL

And everybody knows that meals served at a conference table are the best kind of meals. Business meals.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel hums]

##### [sighs]

I'm gonna trust you there. I've never had a meal  that's not from a tube. With anyone else. [__TREXEL:__ Yum.] Just on my own.

#### TREXEL

Tasty.

##### [pause]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sadness detected! Security alerted.

##### [pause]

#### TREXEL

You look sad, David. Have you been through a psychic shield?

#### DAVID [surprised]

##### [Trexel hums in agreement]

What? No, no. No, I've never been out of this room. Anyway, so you're talking about these psychic shields,  so we criss-cross the planet with them, so there the animals go. They're just walking through psychic shield, psychic shield, psychic shield [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] until they're completely emotionally traumatized.

#### TREXEL

Yes, and they're all furious!

#### DAVID

Absolutely, absolutely livid.

#### TREXEL

Ready to murder.

#### DAVID

Ready to murder. So, we need a way to murder those animals!

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

And a way to cook those animals and a way to serve those animals.

#### TREXEL

Y'know what? Two of those can be solved by our old friend. Lasers.

#### DAVID

Right!

#### TREXEL

♪ You kill and you cook at the same time! Laser Friend, Laser Friend. Cheaper twice the price now! ♫

#### TREXEL AND DAVID

♪ Laser Friend, Laser Friend. ♫

#### TREXEL

♪ Do you want the thing that's dead? ♫

#### TREXEL AND DAVID

#### TREXEL

♪ Well, why not cook it as well instead? ♫

#### TREXEL AND DAVID

♪ Laser Friend, Laser Friend! ♫

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Laser Friend Trademarked.

#### DAVID

Right, well I'm on board with the lasers now. It's a good song!

#### TREXEL

It's a-- It's a good song!

#### DAVID

It's a good song, so that means I completely agree with everything the song said!

#### TREXEL

Everything-- Everything that sort of rhymes is right.

#### DAVID

Pretty much! That's what I've learned.

#### TREXEL

##### [pause]

We give them-- We give them all laser rifles.  David.

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

I feel like we might have forgotten an incredibly core element.

#### DAVID

...Yes?

#### TREXEL

It's a prank planet, David. It's a prank planet!

#### DAVID

...Right.

#### TREXEL

Where's the prank?

#### DAVID [slowly]

The prank is that all of your food has been horribly emotionally traumatized.

#### TREXEL

Exactly! As you eat it you taste the sadness, and you're like, "Mmm! This-- This-- This jelly's quite nice, but there's something there. What is it?" And then you jump out from behind a bush and say, "It was traumatized! Haha!"

#### DAVID

Yes, so you've got--

#### TREXEL

And everyone feels sad.

#### DAVID

Right, well I guess we need a lot of big bushes, for Megatron to hide behind then.

#### TREXEL

Oh, there has to be plenty of big bushes.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Otherwise, what will the animals graze on?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

It's a good question.

#### DAVID

It's a very good question. What do these animals--

#### TREXEL

Well-- Well, I was thinking, David. I'm always thinking.

#### DAVID [under his breath]

Right.

#### TREXEL

I'm always there.

#### DAVID

So we need to make sure that these rare delicacies graze only on bushes.

#### TREXEL

Oh, sure. Can't have anything that doesn't eat bushes. Otherwise, I don't know what they're gonna eat. Each other? Oh my god, David, they can also eat each other.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Thus, the flavours mingle. [__DAVID:__ Right!] Don't-- don't you want to eat a sort of leopard thing that's eaten a sort of horse thing and be like, "Mmm!" What do they taste like now?

#### DAVID

So you want some sort of like...empirical beautiful jelly?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

That's been eaten by a bee.

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

Why not! Maybe it's made of royal jelly. Maybe it's remixed the rare delicacies into new rarer delicacies.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. And it-- and it-- and it grows exponentially, because maybe that bee has been eaten by some sort of tentaculum.

#### DAVID

Yeah, it's a kind of delectable alchemy.

#### TREXEL

Mmm! Taste these tentacula deep-fried rings. You can really taste the royal jelly from a bee!

#### DAVID

Well, whatever Megatron really wants to do with this planet, anyone who visits will definitely have an experience.

#### TREXEL

And that experience dining is what it's all about.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

When you're trying to schmooze a client, experienced dining. Confuse them, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] alarm them, entice them. Experienced dining.

#### DAVID

Here is an emotionally traumatized quadruped that's been eaten by an emotionally traumatized octoped, that's been eaten by an emotionally traumatized nonaped, which has been eaten by an emotionally traumatized decaped, and now it's on your plate because we killed it with a laser!

#### TREXEL

And it's all inside a big confusing bird.

#### DAVID

Why not.

#### TREXEL

Tasty, tasty bird. Excellent! Excellent. I think that's covered pretty much all we need to! You can entertain your guests on the delicacies that have been the most emotionally traumatized of any animals you've ever seen, you've already cooked them with your laser gun, and also the pranks in there. Look what you're eating. You're eating sadness. [__DAVID:__ Ssssadness.] You're eating-- your t-- your big plate of sadness.

#### DAVID [deadpan]

What a good prank.

#### TREXEL

And then you're thinking, "Why do I feel so sad?" and then Megatron comes up to you and says, "It's because of the humans! The humans make you feel sad! Join and rise! Rise up with me!"

#### DAVID

Right. Well, I think we've really successfully galvanized a anti-human revolution.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning: culpability detected.

#### TREXEL [stammering]

Well, I mean it's not-- just-- a spaceship, what do I care--

#### IMOGEN

Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

##### [David and Trexel yelling over each other] IMOGEN: [beep]

##### [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

We've got security! It's not important. Well, come on, David! Quickly!Would you like to submit?  Submitting.

#### TREXEL

There it is.

#### DAVID

And there it goes.

#### TREXEL

Perfect. Another nugget of pure quantum gold from Trexel Geistman.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

You're so talented, Trexel.

#### TREXEL [quietly]

I am.

#### DAVID [quietly]

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I am. But there's plenty more celebrating to be done, David.

#### DAVID [slightly worried]

Well, what-- No, Trexel--

#### TREXEL

Only three days-- Only remember two of them.

#### DAVID

Why doesn't the-- Trexel, why don't you just try and, maybe, sleep for a night and-- and relish that strange action. Really, sleeping is the ball of planet design.

#### TREXEL

##### [thud]

David, if you're not here, and I'm not there, and by here and there I mean the edges of my vision are beginning to darken, then what the hell do you know about me? I'm falling over now!

#### DAVID

Oh, right. There he goes.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant unconscious.

##### [bwoop of lights turning off]

#### DAVID [whispering]

##### [grunts, bwoop, whoosh]

##### [grunts]

Actually... If I just grab his arm... It opens the door?  Ah, there's the door bit...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

##### [bwoop, whoosh]

#### DAVID

##### [softly]

Now he won't be late. Good one, David. Good one, David.

##### [show theme starts]
