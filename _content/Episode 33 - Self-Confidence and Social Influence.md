##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID

##### [distressed]

Oh dear. Oh no, oh dear.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Would you like another session?

#### DAVID

##### [beep]

No-- not now, IMOGEN. There isn't time! I'm in a... pickle! I don't know what Standards wants but I'm pretty sure if I don't get a lot better sales very soon it will be *very, very* bad. Hmm. I have to impress Standards. Yes, that must be it. But... b-but when I try to do well, try to do it my way, it was a total disaster! Maybe I just need to... t-trust Trexel? No! That sounds stupid. I can still see all those pleading, adorable eyes. But what's the alternative? Wait. Wait, wait. M-m-maybe-- IMOGEN?  C-can you give me access to the consultant sales training manuals?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yes.

#### DAVID

Oh, thank Board!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Please note: I cannot guarantee that other departments are not now monitoring the information provided to you and that accessing these restricted documents would not alert them to your unusual privileges.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

##### [footsteps approach]

Oh, fantastic. So now I've been nerfed!  Oh, so Trexel really is my only option now.  Right, I'm just going to have to do my best to keep him on side.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

What-- Ah-- Woah!

#### TREXEL

##### [sarcastic]

Is it, is it okay if I were to come in?

#### DAVID

What? Uh, yes. Yes, please.

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

Are you, are you sure?  You're having a, [__DAVID:__ Wait--] a little party with Standards that I'm not invited to. [__DAVID:__ No, no. No, this--] Perhaps I should go back and come back later.

#### DAVID

No no no no no no.

#### TREXEL

No?

#### DAVID

This is your office. This is your office. You need to come in here and do your work. You're good--

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's not my office, David. [__DAVID:__ Yes, it is.] This is the *Sales* office now. It's not mine but apparently it's *yours* with your new friends at Standards.

#### DAVID

No, it-- no, it is your office. It's-- You know, you can come in here and do officey things and--

#### TREXEL

Oh, can I?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [exaggerated]

Oh, thank you, David!

#### DAVID

No. No, I don't mean-- I wasn't trying to--

#### TREXEL

Oh, if I may, if I may come from my other actually my office and come to this, [__DAVID:__ Wait--] your palace of-- What?

#### DAVID

Is this not your office?

#### TREXEL

No, I have an office.

#### DAVID

Wait, were we never in your office?

#### TREXEL

No.

#### DAVID

I thought the consultation room was your office.

#### TREXEL

That? No! No, why would that be *my* office? I mean, I treat it like my office because I'm better than you, but it was actually just the room that you were kept in.

#### DAVID

Oh. Right, that explains why it was so--

#### TREXEL

I have a separate office. It's much nicer.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Wood lined. Mahogany scented. Walnut whipped.

#### DAVID

Not, not dank then.

#### TREXEL

No, not a dank space. No, a-- quite a nice space.

#### DAVID

Fair enough.

#### TREXEL

But that's not where you get to be. But now, but now we're here. And you've got a pod in here.

#### DAVID

Yes, I do.

#### TREXEL

And you've got your new friends in high places.

#### DAVID

No. I-- They're not my friends.

#### TREXEL

So, if you will deign to allow me to step across the threshold--

#### DAVID

Trexel, they threatened me.

#### TREXEL

--cross, cross the Rubicon into David's land, then maybe we can learn something!

#### DAVID

This isn't David's land. This is Trexel's land for teaching David in. One of his lessons. What lesson is it today, um, Professor Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Don't-- I-I--

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Title is inaccurate for both legal and moral reasons.

#### TREXEL

Flattery will get you nowhere!

#### DAVID

Doctor Geistman.

#### TREXEL

##### [sarcastic mood forgotten]

Oh, I quite like it. Okay, well, this lesson today is about one thing.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Some say the most important thing.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Confidence.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

The key with confidence is to believe one thing above all.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

That you, by which I mean I, are, by which I mean am, never wrong. You see?

#### DAVID

Uhhh....

#### TREXEL

Do you need me to go through it again?

#### DAVID

I are never... am wrong?

#### TREXEL

No, I-- you've completely got this wrong, David. They-- I don't even-- I don't understand what they see in you. You know, I don't understand. [__DAVID:__ What?] You... meaning I--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--are, meaning am, never wrong.

#### DAVID

You are never wrong.

#### TREXEL

Thank you.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So--

#### DAVID

I am never wrong?

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

David, um, I'm trying to teach you something and if you're going to be prideful, [__DAVID:__ What?] if you're going to be willful, [__DAVID:__ Um...] then I don't know if I can help you.

#### DAVID

Okay, I am never wrong, but I said it pointing at you. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] And then you are never wrong and then pointing at me?

#### TREXEL

A compromise has been met.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Trexel Geistman is never wrong; David is learning.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Questionable.

#### TREXEL

You see?

#### DAVID

Yes. No, I'm keen to learn. Yes, let's, let's just get to business.

#### TREXEL

So, with that in mind, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] let's look at the brief.

#### DAVID

Oh, the brief! I forgot about the brief. Yes, um, right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

So the client today is, um, Attia Novellia. Uh, uh, pronouns: she/her. And she wants a planet built, uh, because uh, "I'm easily bored and, as a social influencer, new things to talk about would be simply super."

#### TREXEL

Oh, this is going to be tedious, David.

#### DAVID

Um, well, her likes are cute animals--

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

--shiny things--

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

--photo-ops--

#### TREXEL

Sounds about right.

#### DAVID

--and surprises.

#### TREXEL

##### [sarcastic laugh]

Oh, good!

#### DAVID

Umm... Her, her dislikes are unflattering lighting--

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

--being bored--

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

--and walking too far.

#### TREXEL

Uh, well, yes.

#### DAVID

Um, if she was an animal--

#### TREXEL

Well, I, I look forward to the answer to this question.

#### DAVID

--she would be buttery.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

That's not an animal.

#### DAVID

I think she's interpreted it as she would be a buttery animal.

#### TREXEL

That's a food stuff.

#### DAVID

Well, I--

#### TREXEL

I suppose animals are food stuffs. [__DAVID:__ I-I think--] But you don't look at a tasty goat and say, "look, you're juicy."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Juicy goat detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

I-- I think she might want to be an animal covered in butter?

#### TREXEL

Who doesn't want to be an animal covered in butter, David? Actually think about that. Think about being a cat covered in ghee. A clarified duck.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Warning: most, but not all, animals do not appreciate being covered in fat.

#### TREXEL

Think about it.

#### DAVID

No, that would be quite nice.

#### TREXEL

It would be quite nice.

#### DAVID

Hmm.

#### TREXEL

Up until somebody thought, "hmm, you're pre-done. Yum yum yum."

#### DAVID

Well, I'm, I'm sort of buttery already.

#### TREXEL

No, I'm going to stop you--

#### DAVID

Slip sliding around.

#### TREXEL

No, stop you right there.

##### [David falls to the floor and starts sliding around, prolonged "whoa" while slipping around]

#### TREXEL

##### [objects clatter]

##### [glass shatters]

David-- No, Da-Da-- come, Da-David,  stop sliding around!  You're breaking things! David!

#### DAVID

Wo-ah ha!

##### [object shakes, slime sounds]

#### TREXEL

Ah, you slip out of my grasp!

#### DAVID

##### [sliding stops]

Woah oh ah, ooh!  Back in the chair.

#### TREXEL

Look, David, don't think that way. You're not covered in anything edible. That slime all over you [__DAVID:__ Yes.] that is poisonous to every form of life discovered as yet by man or Board.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Everything is poisonous in sufficient quantity.

#### DAVID

I'm, uh, life, and I'm not-- yes, sorry. Yes, Trexel. Poisonous, definitely.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

Continuing. Um, greatest strength. Her greatest strength is positivity. Um, her greatest weakness is lack of coordination.

#### TREXEL

I see. I see. Okay, well--

#### DAVID

That's the brief.

#### TREXEL

So, David, I think this is an absolute... key example [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] of where our, by which I mean my, confidence is going to come into play. This person, what's their name?

#### DAVID

Attia Novellia.

#### TREXEL

Attia Novellia. She is a social influencer and do you know what that means?

#### DAVID

She influences socials.

#### TREXEL

No. She's a shell. An empty shell echoing with the screams that confidence forgot.

#### DAVID

Like a ghost tortoise.

#### TREXEL

Like a ghostly tor-toise that's been ignored by its peers. [__DAVID:__ Right.] "Oh, listen to me, I've got lots of thoughts about walking incredibly slowly across a carpet." But no one's listening because everyone else is a turtle! You get me?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Initial survey results suggest that: no one gets you.

#### DAVID

Uhhhh.... yes.

#### TREXEL

Because you, you know what a social influencer is though, David.

#### DAVID [uncertainly] [groans]

...Somebody who influences socials?

#### TREXEL

What socials, David?

#### DAVID

Umm... IMOGEN.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep] [distorted]

IMOGEN influences IMOGEN.

#### TREXEL

No, no, no. No one influences IMOGEN. IMOGEN influences herself.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Well, the pro-- I suppose the programmers influence IMOGEN but they died a very long time ago under mysterious circumstances with lots of mechanised wounds.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

No foul play detected. Security diverted.

#### DAVID

Hmm...

#### TREXEL

What a social influencer does is they desperately claw at the ether around them through electronic means in order to generate self-worth.

#### DAVID

Like an angry robot?

#### TREXEL

Like an angry robot that's been abandoned by a tor-toise that itself was abandoned.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Abandonment issues detected. Security unconcerned.

#### DAVID

Uh, yes.

#### TREXEL

You're learning now.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So, what we need to do is undermine this person.

#### DAVID

O-- okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [uncomfortable sound]

Because they themselves are on a thin ice of confidence. Otherwise-- [__DAVID:__ Right.] Think about anybody that you know. All the people that you know, David. Think about the ones that are loud and, and rambunctious on the surface and they're constantly pointing at things and saying, "I have an opinion about this. I have an opinion about that." And you haven't asked for their opinion but they're telling you it anyway. Those kind of people, David, those kind of people [__DAVID:__  Trexel....] there's just a, a thin shell between them and the void, the infinite blackness of self-destruction and pain.

#### DAVID

Oh! Uh, no.

#### TREXEL

And if you push them, David, if you push them even slightly--

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

--they will snap! And in this case that means they'll give us their money.

##### [long beat]

#### DAVID

##### [long beat]

Uh... yes.  Um, so--

#### TREXEL

You look pensive, David.

#### DAVID

--undermine--

#### TREXEL

Like a pen that's being sieved.

#### DAVID

--u-undermining--

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

--is that ethical?

#### TREXEL

Ethical.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Ethical. An ethical question.

#### DAVID

'Cause like a lot of the lessons here have been quite... you know, um--

#### TREXEL

Unethical?

#### DAVID

Ethically questionable.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. The questioning of ethics. Okay, so, so that's a, that's a big question. Is it ethical? [__DAVID:__ Mm.] Is this ethical? [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] That's, that's a big question there, David. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] Is it ethical? You know, here we're, we're all philosopher kings, [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] philosopher queens--

#### DAVID

Philosopher Davids.

#### TREXEL

Exactly! And we are in of ourselves our own judges and juries [__DAVID:__ Yes.] to decide [__DAVID:__ Yes.] is this ethical? [__DAVID:__ Yes.] And the answer is... absolutely not, David. There is few things less ethical than needling someone in their confidence. Taking a needle, pushing it through, twisting is round so there's a larger hole, and then connecting it up to a high-pressure hose to explode it with your scorn.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You could-- you literally couldn't get more unethical unless what you're actually doing is arson or murder.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Or betraying the Board. Hail the Board.

#### DAVID

Uh--

#### TREXEL

In many ways, it's arson of a personality and a murder of a soul. I hope that answers your question, David.

#### DAVID

Ehhh...

#### TREXEL

You're killing a person's self.

#### DAVID

##### [quietly to himself]

##### [normally]

But, um... Board... but what if Standards... Oh, no. Um, what am I gonna...  Eh, uh... Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

You alright there, David?  You seem to grow three times more slimy just, just thinking about that.

#### DAVID

Uh... No, I was just thi--

#### TREXEL

Are you up for this?

#### DAVID

Uhh--

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Are you up to this task, David? [__David continues 'um'ing throughout__] Are you ready to cast aside everything you've ever felt is good and right in order to make a sale, David! So you can ding the bell!  *Ding-ding, I made a sale! Maybe someone loves me now!*

#### DAVID

##### [harried]

Yes, okay. I ding the bell.

#### TREXEL

Yes you are ready to ding the bell.

#### DAVID

##### [sobs]

##### [sobs continue]

Ding ding.

#### TREXEL

##### [sounds of bell being taken out]

I've got a bell here, David.  [__DAVID:__ Ding ding.] Ding this bell.

#### DAVID

Oh... uh...

#### TREXEL

Ding the bell.

##### [David makes distressed noises, dings the bell]

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### TREXEL

You can't unring a bell, David. [__DAVID:__ Um...] As much as you try. As much as you shout at the now woken guards, "I didn't mean to ring that bell and you-- I'm not here." That bell's been dinged.

#### DAVID

Mm. Yes.

#### TREXEL

So, how do we apply it to this situation? Let's run down their personality and use our confidence to destroy it. Because, David, we're never wrong, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] and when you tell people things and you're never wrong, that means they are wrong.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um, well... they like new things to talk about [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] and they're easily bored, so...

#### TREXEL

Okay, so you go in there and you say, "guess what? Everything new is trash. Everything from *my* childhood that I experienced, that's great. That's gravy. That's a proven theorem of good. Anything that you like, anything that's new, it's bad. It's terrible. It's made of plastic. It's made of sadness."

#### DAVID

Right, so you're, you want to basically sell them on nostalgia.

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

But from your childhood, not theirs.

#### TREXEL

Nostalgia, nostalgia is the engine room of telling people that they're wrong and you're right.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

It was better in my day because it was *my* day. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And therefore, by definition, it was better. And the wonderful thing about this, David, is history is wonderfully malleable. Because lots of the people are dead now and they can't gainsay you. And the people that were there you just tell them that their memory's wrong.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Incorrect, sir. Turns out I didn't kill that man. It was the wind that did it. In fact, I warned him. And now I've got the Victoria's Cross.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Wind murders suspect list updated. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Um, right. So, how exactly is... I mean, I'm fully on board with the method [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] but I just have one question of how is convincing them that everything in your childhood is better than anything they could experience gonna help us sell... a planet.

#### TREXEL

Because, David, you can't be an effective sales opponent if the, the very foundations of your knowledge have been washed away like a child's sandcastle.

#### DAVID

Uh, okay, um--

#### TREXEL [yelling at the top of his lungs]

##### [David starts fake sobbing which turns into crying]

*I am the sea! And I will destroy your castle of sand! Weep ye children!*  *Weep ye children who wish to build in this sandy world! The tide will destroy!*

#### DAVID

##### [crying continues, getting more real]

I didn't even have a childhood and I'm sorry.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Now, now try-- look, the terms are punitive. Agree to them.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Agree to my terms! Agree to my punitive terms!

#### DAVID

##### [sobs]

O-okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [David's sobbing continues]

Of course you have you sad, sad sack.  You understand?

#### DAVID

##### [takes a few breaths and starts calming down]

Oh.

#### TREXEL

You feel that hollow feeling inside?

#### DAVID

Oh. Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

Like, like everything that you believed was wrong and you woke up one day and there was a note that had been slid under the door saying,  "everything was pointless."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Shallow nihilism detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

##### [softly]

Oh... yes.

#### TREXEL

Yeah. That's how, that's how we beat them.

#### DAVID

I, I do feel like that now.

#### TREXEL

Come on, keep going. Keep going. Let's, let's, let's rattle through these.

#### DAVID

I mean, but, but why though?

#### TREXEL

Why?

#### DAVID

Why even bother?

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Because we're learning to be salespeople, David. This is what being a salesperson is.

##### [long beat]

#### DAVID

##### [back to normal]

Oh, yes, Sales. Standards. Right. Yes, there we go. That's why. Hooh.

#### TREXEL

Now, what do they actually want built?

#### DAVID

Well, so, they're easily bored as a social influencer [__TREXEL:__ Right.] so they need things to talk about because that will be simply super. That's, that's the planet.

#### TREXEL

That's the entirety.

#### DAVID

They want new things.

#### TREXEL

This person is so superficial. They're going to go over like a house of cards, David! [__DAVID:__ Well, well this is what--] And those cards are made of tears.

#### DAVID

Well, look. So, this is what they like, they like cute animals, [__TREXEL:__ Right.] shiny things, [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] photo-ops, and surprises. Okay?

#### TREXEL

Okay, fine. Well, then we say, "look, you'll have all of those. But all of them will be metaphorical. And by metaphorical, I mean everything in that list will be a 2-D cutout that, if you touch it, falls over in a sad manner."

#### DAVID

Wait, no, hang on a minute. Now we're just designing a planet to make them sad.

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

No, but I don't--

#### TREXEL

Sell people on the sadness they secretly crave.

#### DAVID

So, you're saying we're, we're gonna pitch to Attia Novellia: by the way, the planet you wanted, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] we're not going to do that. [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] We're going to do some sort of hollow mocking facade of it.

#### TREXEL

Exactly, because you're--

#### DAVID

And we're just gonna--

#### TREXEL

Because you're worthless scum.

#### DAVID

So, we're just gonna say that to her face.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

No tricks or anything. We're just going to literally say--

#### TREXEL

Oh, no. The more brazen, the better.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Now, you must understand, David, going back to the earlier question: is this ethical? There are few things less ethical than what I'm telling you to do now!

#### DAVID

Well, I guess at least he's honest.

#### TREXEL

But what I'm telling you, David, is it works.

#### DAVID

Right. So, literally selling people on a thing they don't want, [__TREXEL:__ Yep.] but telling them they want it because they're trash.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. Like diet plans.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [upbeat music]

##### [music ends]

Stellar Firma's legal department would like to make it clear that only *some* diet plans are manipulative and dangerous lies. For a copy of  "Keeping Fit the Stellar Firma Way", please contact your quadrant sales representative.

#### DAVID

Ugh. Uh, okay. Um, so, so we're gonna g-- Right, well, [supposed you're willing??] Um, if we're going to sell them on something they really, really, really don't like, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] then we should just go full hog, right?

#### TREXEL

The whole hog. Get two hogs!

#### DAVID

Okay. Right, and just make them, like, really angry.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells]

Yeah, or sad. In fact, get these two hogs and sit them down in front of a film. It's about another hog, a hog with dreams that wants to become a carpenter but then it discovers its, its stupid hog hooves aren't dexterous enough to do carpentry!  *You can't use a lathe, you stupid hog!*

#### DAVID

Okay. Um, sure. Well--

#### TREXEL

We'll call it *Hog Lathe*.

#### DAVID

*Hog Lathe*. Well, no, we'll--

#### TREXEL

A cinematic experience by Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID

No, we'll-- Should we put that in the back burner.

#### TREXEL

Starring David 7 as a hog.

#### DAVID

##### [drawer opens]

Wait, no, here we go.  Nope, I've opened the drawer. I've opened the drawer.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay. What's-- Oh, I can see all my things in the drawer!

#### DAVID

No, we're j-- Ah, we're just gonna take it-- We're just gonna--

#### TREXEL

Could I have them back?!?

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel distressed noise]

##### [Trexel kisses it]

No, we're just gonna put it in the drawer for later.  Oh, in it goes. Into the later drawer. [__TREXEL:__ Aw.] Not forgotten. Look, would-- Do you want to give it a goodbye kiss?  Okay, now it's going in the drawer.

#### TREXEL

I want all that back at the end of term.

##### [drawer closes]

#### DAVID

Now it's gone. Well, yes. Of course. Of course.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Well, these-- this is the later drawer, not the never drawer.

#### TREXEL

I like the later drawer!

#### DAVID

Yes. Exactly.

#### TREXEL

I don't like the never drawer.

#### DAVID

Yes, well we're not going to put anything in the never drawer. But in the now drawer is the lessons.

#### TREXEL

Is the now drawer just this room?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay! I'm in a drawer.

#### DAVID

Yes. We're in a drawer. We're in the now drawer. Anyway, back to what I was saying.

#### TREXEL

I hope a kindly person opens the drawer and takes me out and uses me to make soup!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Geistman soup detected. Catering alerted.

#### DAVID

O... kay. Um, right, well--

#### TREXEL

I like soup.

#### DAVID

Yeah, now, so you're rem-- With your hog story film--

#### TREXEL

The hog story.

#### DAVID

--is in the later drawer.

#### TREXEL

*Hog Lathe*.

#### DAVID

Yes. You, you made me think. Now, so, Attia wants to be a buttery animal.

#### TREXEL

I'd forgotten about that bit but yes.

#### DAVID

Well, so, she-- we don't want to make her a buttery animal.

#### TREXEL

No!

#### DAVID

Because that's the thing she wants to be.

#### TREXEL

That would be weird. Also, it would mean we'd have to take butter in the room, and I haven't got any butter right now.

#### DAVID

But what if this planet was covered in buttery animals? Now, this isn't giving her what she wants because she wants to *be* a buttery animal, but she will *never* be a buttery animal--

#### TREXEL

Can these buttery animals be behind a fence that she can see through but not cross?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Excellent stuff.

#### DAVID

They're in a butter box.

#### TREXEL

They're in a butter box!

#### DAVID

Wait, no, we're just designing a planet again. What--

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ It's the-- ♫

##### [sings]

__TREXEL and DAVID:__  ♪ --butter box. ♫

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

♪ It really cuts you off from the buttery animals you want to be. Fear us, fear us, now you flee. ♫

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh, right.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings, kind of]

♪ Butter box! ♫

#### DAVID

The butter box.

#### TREXEL

Trademarked by Trexel Geistman.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Hog played by David 7.

#### DAVID

No!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Butter box patented.

#### DAVID

That's not in the now drawer.

#### TREXEL

##### [softly]

No, it's in the later drawer.

#### DAVID

But the, but the, but the hog--

#### TREXEL

But the butter box.

#### DAVID

The butter box.

#### TREXEL

Wait, sometimes, David, it's important to go in with the-- into a meeting with a little bit of a rough idea. We can't just walk in there and say, "oh, we're going to do something."

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Don't worry about it. A little bit of a planet design, it's all par for the course.

#### DAVID

Okay, well that's--

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

It's just that the course has been massively warped in your perceptions by my continuous ignoring of the course over the entirety that we've known you! *What are we supposed to do at any point, David?! I've made it very unclear!*

#### DAVID

Um... we are gonna sell a planet to Attia Novellia by undermining her self-confidence, sense of self, soul, and possibly murder her?

#### TREXEL

Close enough for me. Now, remember, in this interaction we've tried it the David 7 way. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] We've tried Good David, Good Trexel. We've tried that and what happened?

#### DAVID [dejected]

...We gave them everything they wanted.

#### TREXEL

We gave them everything they wanted. We're going the other way, David. We're giving them *nothing* that they want. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] And remember, what's the lesson?

#### DAVID

Um--

#### TREXEL

##### [simultaneous]

That... you... I... are... am... never wrong.

#### DAVID

##### [simultaneous]

I... is... or never... ever... correct, not.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Nailed it.

#### DAVID

Um... yes. Yes, that.

#### TREXEL

You're ready. You're ready, David.

#### DAVID

Am I?

#### TREXEL

Are you, David? Remember the lesson.

#### DAVID

##### [long pause]

I...  Yes.

#### TREXEL

Excellent stuff.

#### DAVID

##### [loud knocks begin]

Okay. Um, right, so--  They're here, so, um...

#### TREXEL

Let's go!

#### DAVID

##### [knocking stops]

In we go to undermine their...  personality and... sell them a planet... that they don't want.

#### TREXEL

You monster, I love you.

#### DAVID

Oh. Oh.

##### [large door opens, camera shutter clicks]

#### TREXEL

##### [from meeting room]

Ah, Attia, you disappointing shell of a tor-toise. Sit down! Close the door! LISTEN TO ME!!!

#### DAVID

Oh, no.
