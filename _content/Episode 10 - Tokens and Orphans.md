Searching for: "Trexel Geistman." Search complete. ERROR: Consultant complaint file: full. Goodbye.

#### DAVID [sigh]

##### [sing-song]

##### [faint footsteps approaching]

Well, that's about right I suppose. Another review day he's late for, another step closer to my inevitable doom  doom doom do-doom doomy doom. Doom. Doom. Where did he say he was going to be?  Some sort of gig?

##### [door swooshes open]

#### DAVID [startled gasp]

#### TREXEL [singing passionately]

##### [Trexel singing slightly more quietly]

When stars are born, and gas will flow, [__DAVID:__ Trexel.] I see your eyes, [__DAVID:__ Trexel.] and I do know [__DAVID:__ Trexel.] that you are the one for *me.* [__DAVID:__ *Trexel*.] How can you not see? [__DAVID:__ Trexel!] Our love, it grows! And the supernova knows! [__DAVID:__ Trexel.] Oh, come with me, [__DAVID:__ *Trexel*.] and you will *be* [__DAVID:__ Trexel!]  with... me...

#### DAVID

Are you done?

#### TREXEL

David, I am more than done, I am completed. I have seen true art, David. True, pure art. I look at what we do here, scrambling around, making planets for-- for-- for-- for clients, and I think "What? What is this ash in our hand?" [__DAVID:__ Trexel.] True art is music, David. [__DAVID:__ Did you-- did-- di--] True art is what flows from the hands and mouths of the greatest band [__DAVID:__ Did--] I have ever seen in my life.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Did you have to go see art during their lunch-time matinee on a Friday?

#### TREXEL

David, David, I am but a servant of art. And I'd already booked the tickets. What am I going to do, book the tickets and then not *go*? They're very expensive tickets, David!

#### DAVID

Hartro knows where you are! And now Hartro knows you're here! For the review! Which you have missed and are late for!

##### [faint footsteps approaching]

#### TREXEL

The review's... today?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk] [beep]

Line Manager arriving.

##### [door swooshing open]

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Oh, hello! Oh, hello, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Hartro!__HARTRO:__ Ahhh! You look like a worm!

#### TREXEL

Ah, well, that's, that's me--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

And David. Of the seventh. Mmmm. Hi, boys!

#### TREXEL

Hello. Um...

#### HARTRO

I think right about now, Trexel, you're gonna try to tell me what you've been up to.

#### TREXEL

Now I need to tell you that [__HARTRO:__ Hmm.] I had a very good reason to be late. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] I was seeing Gimble--

#### HARTRO

--Are you going to offer me a chair?

#### TREXEL

A chair? Yes, yes, David!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Yes, I'd like to get comfortable for this explanation. I want to get nice and cozy while I watch you squirm.

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay.

##### [Trexel and David mutter to one another about David getting up out of the chair]

#### HARTRO

There we go. Ooh!

#### TREXEL

So, I went to see The Ronies. Turns out: not on that night. I've lost a day somewhere. Not sure how. So I re-booked to see Gimble Hulk and the Probe Knowers. [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] Who are wonderful! You must go see them, [__HARTRO:__ No.] Hartro. You, y-- okay. Well, I saw them and, and truly I think of it as work of a sort. Because the perspective they gave me [__HARTRO:__ Hmm.] on, on creativity and art and-- and-- and, you know, isn't designing a song much like designing a planet when you really think about it?

#### HARTRO

Is-- is that the way you're going with this?

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

That's what I'm going with, yes.

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

Oh, yes. Oh, right. So you've been doing homework.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, it was, it was *fieldwork*!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Ohh. Ohhhh. Yes, it's not gonna work. [__TREXEL: [crestfallen]__ Oh.] No, no. Do you realize that when you make me wait, you pay?

#### TREXEL [realizing]

Oh.

#### HARTRO

You hurt me, I hurt you.

#### TREXEL

Please, don't, don't do that, Hartro--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

It's quite simple, isn't it? It's like two sides of an equation.

#### TREXEL

Except both sides are full of sadness and pain.

#### HARTRO

They are for *you*. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, um.] Yes. It does make me feel better though. So, to make you pay: we have had a little accident with your Gimble Hulk and the Probe Knowers.

#### TREXEL

What's happened to Gimble? [__HARTRO:__ Well, I--] What's happened to the Probe Knowers? They're good people, Hartro! They're good, sweet, innocent people!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

They were, *were*. Were.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

They... were...

#### HARTRO

##### [sarcastic gasp]

Yes. They got an invitation, didn't they? They were so excited! They got an invitation from the Winter Lettuce Collective.  So we sent--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

No... no... We know that they're a murderer though!__HARTRO:__ Well, we do, don't we?

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### HARTRO

So we've sent them straight up to have a *grand* old time. And funny enough, we haven't heard a thing from them since.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I see. This is a "reap what you sow" sort of a deal, is it? I make you wait, and therefore you take something I love and put it in a pod with a murderer with knife-dogs and explosives. It's a tale as old as time, Hartro! I understand. [__HARTRO:__ Good] I understand. Well, I promise that this is the last time. You know, when it was things being taken from me? I can deal with that. But when you kill something pure...

#### HARTRO

When *you*.

#### TREXEL

When... *I...* kill something pure. I-- I couldn't stand for that! I promise you, and you, David, [__David groans doubtfully]__ that I will be on time now. You-- you've shown me the light, Hartro. And the light is the corpses of great artists.

#### HARTRO

I'm so sorry someone had to die.

#### TREXEL

##### [David groans]

I am also sorry that someone had to die. David, are you sorry that someone had to die?  He seems sorry.

#### HARTRO

##### [contented sigh]

Well, I'm glad that's clear, Trexel. Moving on. Oh! I feel wonderful! First, can I tell you how wonderful I feel? I have just been to the Stellar Firma Limited Annual Intergalactic Space Ball.  [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] All last night I danced, I sang, I drank... Oh! People adored me. I-- me and the Design Team, we had such a blast! Look, look, look. Ooh! I've got this hologram here.

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk] [beep]

##### [ascending beeps of an album opening on holovision]

Opening hologram album "Hartro and the Whole Team."

#### HARTRO

Lookit! That's all of us.

#### TREXEL

##### [trails off]

Oh, well, look! That's you and all the... all the... team. [__HARTRO:__ There's Diane.] I... I don't think I was, um... [__HARTRO:__ There's Brant, oh, a charmer.] I don't-- I don't think I was, uhh... invited to that. Maybe there was some sort of mistake. Surely I would've been invited to that. I'm one of the design team. And I...

#### HARTRO

Oh, you'd think, yes-- no-- no. And last year you did come, didn't you, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

And do you remember what a disaster that was?

#### TREXEL

Let me think back. Um... I'm drawing a real blank-- Oh no wait! There is something.

#### HARTRO

It involved a punch bowl.

#### TREXEL

##### [shouting]

Yes, there was a big punch bowl full of, full of punch and there: I'm-- I'm in the punch bowl [__HARTRO:__ That happened.] and I'm not wearing anything at all and I'm swinging a ladle around my head and saying, "Get away from me! *I* am a *genius*!" And then I was escorted away. And then these people hit me for about 45 minutes. Is that what you're referring to?

#### HARTRO

I was.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes, that makes sense. You don't want that guy in the punch bowl. [__HARTRO:__ You don't.] I hadn't washed in a while. That punch was *not* potable.

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel mutters in annoyance]

The punch was delicious last night. Oh, wonderful.] Oh, in fact, I drank *way* too much. But don't you worry, I've had an induced regression deep sleep and most of my blood has been recirculated. I feel fantastic!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

That would explain why you're glowing! You're glowing! You're glowing! [__HARTRO:__ Mmm.] In fact, I think if I turned off all the lights, you'd still be able to see everything because of the glow coming off of your skin.

#### HARTRO

Are you done?__TREXEL:__ I am, absolutely, done.

#### HARTRO

Right. Getting on to the planets!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO [sighs]

##### [Trexel hums]

Megatron_46, we'll start there. Now, Trexel.  You know they have a known history of plotting against us humans.

#### TREXEL

They hate us.

#### HARTRO

Yes. Now you've gone and made them a prank planet.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Lighten the mood. Make everybody feel like it's a bit of fun. Oh, you know, bygones be bygones. Here's some traumatized meat.

#### HARTRO

I don't understand why you do these things! You know, there is a consequence for everything that you do. And they've gone and got well upset with us, and they've executed an attack.

#### TREXEL

An attack? Oh, quick! Action stations! Put up the defenses! Call the brigades!

#### IMOGEN

Attack warning.

##### [alarms sounding]

#### IMOGEN

Security: alerted.

#### HARTRO

Oh, right, right. Hush now, it's already happened.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### IMOGEN [stops all alarms]

All clear.

#### TREXEL

Can't say I noticed an attack.

#### HARTRO

No, they've already done a full-fledged attack. They were coming after us, and guess what they've done: they've gone after-- Do you remember Megatron_32?

#### TREXEL

Ah... Oh yes. They wanted a-- a very personalized planet, and I thought, "What would I want?" And I thought, "Where do I live?" And I thought, "On the Stellar Firma space station!" And so I built one of those and gave it to them.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, that was ridiculous, wasn't it?

#### TREXEL

It was a precise copy of our space station. It was very easy to design.

#### HARTRO

And that's what they've blown up. Do you see what's happened?

#### TREXEL

They blew it up thinking it was us!

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

A decoy! Well, in many ways, isn't this a genius move on my part? Years before,I make a decoy-- a decoy space station and then when we finally, inevitably annoy the Megatrons, and they try and kill us, they kill that one instead!

#### HARTRO

Now, if you had actually planned for the future and executed that thinking that you were going to protect us in some way, then yes, that would be genius. But that's not exactly--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

--that's not exactly what happened.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

--that's not exactly what happened.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

No, I got lazy and just used a design and...

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

But it's all worked out!

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel gasps]

I would like to present you with these two shiny drink coupons  to use at the Cosmic Lounge. [__TREXEL:__ I love drinks.] Now, no-- Now listen. I'm giving these to you because something very, very terrible that you did [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] managed to *accidentally* work in your favour. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, I can see them. Can I--] Do you understand?

#### TREXEL

I-- I understand.

#### HARTRO

It's not, It's not necessarily a reward. [__TREXEL:__ No.] It's because something horrible that you did accidentally worked out okay because of something else horrible that you did.

#### TREXEL

It's like that old saying: two wrongs make a right!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Not a saying.

#### HARTRO

So, these are for you to use in the Cosmic Lounge at your leisure. [__TREXEL:__ I'll--] And I'll just keep them right here. [__TREXEL:__ No, I'll--] I'll just keep them right here inside my brassiere. [__TREXEL:__ Oh. Okay. Right.] Just to keep them safe for you. [__TREXEL:__ That's okay.] But those are yours, Trexel! [__TREXEL:__ And, and I'll get them at the end.] Those belong to you. [__TREXEL:__ I'll get them at the end.] Remind me at the end. [__TREXEL:__ I will, yes.] Yes. [__TREXEL:__ Ohhh.] Two lovely drinks for you, Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, lovely, lovely, that'll be a good start. Mmm.] Yeah.

##### [...]

#### HARTRO

David?

#### DAVID

Mm. Y-- yes. Yes. Yes, Hartro?

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Is he--? It felt like he was breathing.

#### TREXEL

He does that, he does that. [__HARTRO:__ He--] David, just stop breathing.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Um. Uh.

#### TREXEL

##### [David inhales and holds his breath]

Just shut your mouth, shut your nose, don't breathe through your ears.

#### HARTRO

Shut holes.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. He'll be fine over there.

#### HARTRO

Alright. Great.

#### TREXEL

So--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

It's very, very distracting. To have, to have a clone behind you breathing.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

I know! I-- I-- I don't like it. He just-- He's like a steam train, huffing away in the corner there. You know what's worse?

#### HARTRO

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [David's attempt at speech muffled because he is still holding his breath]

##### [muffled speech]

##### [muffled speech]

When he opens his mouth. Oh, it's bad. David, you alright over there? You're turning a bit blue. Can you stop it? It's quite distracting.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

I think--  Hartro, I think he might die if we don't let him breathe.

#### HARTRO

Don't worry.

#### TREXEL

Okay!

#### HARTRO

There's more where he came from!

#### TREXEL [laughing]

There is! Because! He's disposable.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO [inhales through her teeth]

Your second planet: Lady Wimr Ikipidash. Ah... That's funny, because-- Oh! Me and the other design teams-- We've got such a little joke going on about that. They're calling you 'Sock Boy'!

#### TREXEL

Sock Boy?!

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Sock Boy?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

That-- that's--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I think it's quite fitting.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Redesignating consultant status to Sock Boy.

#### TREXEL [indignant ugh]

Sock Boy.

#### HARTRO

##### [rustling]

In fact, I've got you this: it's a gigantic sock.  [__TREXEL:__ Oh.] I'd like you to wear this when you're out and about.

#### TREXEL

But it's just one enormous sock. My foot will be lost in there!

#### HARTRO

No, you can wear it on your head, I thought. As if a-- [__TREXEL:__ Oh, I... Like a--] Like a hat.

#### TREXEL

Do I ha-- have to wear this hat?

#### HARTRO

You *have* to wear that hat. When you're seen in the Design Team corridor, you have to wear that hat.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO [dead serious]

If I don't see it on your head, and we pass in the design corridor, there will be punishment.

#### TREXEL

Oh, absolutely. No, I will--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

You will wear that hat.

#### TREXEL

##### [David exhales loudly]

I'll wear it with pride. Look at me! Trexel. Sock Boy. Old Socky Geistman. Try-- try and pack him in a sock. He'll come through! That's what it's saying. It's saying, "Look! Even with a sock on him, he's still the best!"

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Oh!

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

David! Please, will you stop breathing!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

##### [David pants for breath]

Stop breathing!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

You're breathing everywhere!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I'm so distracted! Ugh!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

I barely-- Oh look! What's this thing on my head? Maybe I'll drop it on the floor and stamp on it.

#### HARTRO

Don't you dare. You put that up and you stick it on your head.

#### TREXEL [muttering]

Alright, I'll put it on my head. I'm putting it on, I'm putting it on.

#### HARTRO

Yes, so, you've had all the socks and the trash redirected from the black holes. Yada, yada, yada, yada. You created an eyesore.

#### TREXEL

An eyesore? I--

#### HARTRO

It's disgusting.

#### TREXEL

They wanted a-- a-- a trash world, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

I know, but couldn't you just do something with the trash?! To make it look a bit more appealing. I mean...

#### TREXEL

We did somewhat go with piles, didn't we, David? Just big piles. I seem to remember that was your idea [__DAVID:__ What? Um.] if I'm remembering that correctly. Just big piles of trash?

#### DAVID

##### [flatly]

Yes, fine, all my idea. Piles, piles, I said. [__TREXEL:__ See?] Trexel tried to stop me, but I insisted because I have... so much decision-making power in this, yes.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

And you see how sassy he is?

#### HARTRO

Are you just going to let him push you around?

#### TREXEL

No, no I'm not!

#### HARTRO

Are you-- Trexel, are you the sort of man that lets his clone push him around? [__TREXEL:__ No.] That's what I'm seeing.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Nononono. That was, uh, that was all very honest. That was no...

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Now, David--

#### HARTRO

I'd like you to put him in his spot and make me believe it.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Right. David. Right. Look at me, David. You [__DAVID:__ Yes.] are a puddle of urine. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] I have seen better puddles of urine on the floor of a men's bathroom at a sporting event! David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] You smell as if a week-old side of ham has been put in an oven with a big sack of used exercise wear, and just put on low. [__DAVID:__ Right.] And just cooked on low. And you open it, and that hot fog, that hot meaty sweat fog that comes out? That is just a small reflection of what you are, Sally boy!

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

##### [getting increasingly angry]

##### [suddenly calm]

Shut up!  You shut up! And you stop judging me with your eyes! [__HARTRO:__ It's very difficult to take--] 'Cause I'm a big boy now! [__HARTRO:__ --take you seriously.] And I'm tall! And I'm strong! And I am a genius! I love you, you idiot! Get out! Don't look at me! Is that, is that what you were looking for, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Ooh. Aah!

#### TREXEL

Really put him in his place there.

#### DAVID [flatly]

Uh. Yes, I am very... place-put. I'll-- I'll go back to--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I feel you've revealed something, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Really?

#### HARTRO

Hm. Slightly.

#### TREXEL

##### [slight laugh in his voice]

What, about-- about me and my interpersonal relationships and my crushing, crushing self-worth problems?  I don't think so! I think I just asserted my authority there. Uh, did I assert my authority there well enough, Hartro? Please tell me I asserted my authority well enough--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

It's very difficult to take you seriously in that hat.

#### TREXEL

Well, you made me wear--

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

##### [contented sigh]

I love it.

#### TREXEL

I look like a weird foot-elf.

#### HARTRO [stifling a laugh]

You do.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Hypnos Soulbiter. I'm going to move on. The Pillow Planet. [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] Hmmm. What a *complete* disaster we have on our hands now. Ohhhh, Trexel. Ohhhh, Trexel. Can you just hit him? David, I'm talking to you. [__DAVID:__ What?] Can you just give him a hit?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### HARTRO

It's okay. Nothing will happen. Just give him a little hit.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

I just-- I don't-

#### TREXEL

##### [David hits Trexel]

Come on, David.

#### HARTRO

There we go.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Authorized clone violence logged.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispering]

...Ow.  You'll get yours, David.

##### [...]

#### HARTRO

Yes, back to the Pillow Planet. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Oh, what were you thinking! You created a *dream-eating monster*. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] What a mess. Now, what I don't understand: [__TREXEL:__ Mhm.] If you're going to create a monster, why don't you create some sort of boundary? Invisible fence? An electrocution device? What were you thinking?!

#### DAVID [softly]

Ah. Yes. That's-

#### TREXEL

So I'm going, I'm going to extrapolate here from what you've said. [__HARTRO:__ Please.] I'm going to take a wild guess that the haunting, terrifying, super-powered monster that eats dreams that we created for a religion has somewhat escaped the planet we made it on and is now, let's say... running amok?

#### HARTRO

Ah, bingo! You get a prize!

#### TREXEL

What's the prize?! I love prizes!

#### HARTRO

Hit him again.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

No! no!

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, sorry, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

##### [David hits Trexel] [Trexel whispers]

Oh, it's fine. It's not fine. I'm gonna get you.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Authorized clone violence logged.

#### HARTRO

So they've escaped. And I've had to fix it. But, don't worry, I've relocated them to Quarterspy Biosphere.

#### TREXEL

Oh, right! Right.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

One of the dead zones!

#### HARTRO

Yes, yes, and I've had holovision go and pick it up. And they've created a lovely show of it. They've got the monster running around, chasing people. It's all on film. It's fantastic viewing! Everyone's tuned in.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful.

#### HARTRO

So well done, me!

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes. [__DAVID:__ Oh wait-well done, Hartro. Yes, well done Hartro. Very good.] You've taken our monster and turned it into a block-busting reality show where people are chased down by a frightening, dream-eating monster that consumes them.

#### DAVID

Well, t-- to be fair, that was the monster's purpose, just on *that* planet. So it's probably...

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Yes, but on that planet, people chose to go there... With this one, I don't know how they--

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Did they?

#### TREXEL

You know what, I'm not entirely sure. The whole religion thing got so out of hand. So, are these just regular people, or...?

#### HARTRO

Oh, no, no. No, we only use people who've been imprisoned, people who... needed to be fired but we didn't know where to relocate them to. Is that? Yes. Yes, yes.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Right, right, redundancy, that sort of thing. Well, you've got to, you've got to do something with those people, I suppose. Why not have them... have their very souls consumed by a monster. Yes! No, that's a wonderful fix!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

You know, people that might be embarrassments. Hm. Just know there's a place to go for everyone!

#### TREXEL

Yes! Everybody's got a place to go! And sometimes that place eats your dreams. Okay. Wonderful. Wonderful.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Wouldn't that be interesting? If Trexel was devoured by his own creation?

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Oh, we're going right to it.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Ohhh! I didn't quite think about that.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Oh, right in! Oh, I thought we were just dancing around it but we're there. We're there now.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

What a beautiful ending.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Please don't.__HARTRO: [crosstalk]__ David? You're smiling.__DAVID: [crosstalk]__ I-- No. I will be blended at the time.

#### HARTRO

Oh, that's right.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

So that's...

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Yes, David, you remember--

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I would enjoy it now then, David. Enjoy the vision now. In case you're blended when it happens.

#### TREXEL [whispering]

David, if I go, you go. Remember that.

#### DAVID

Yes, understood.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

We're in this together, David.

#### DAVID

Yes, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay. So. We're all just having a lovely joke about me being-- me being... soul-eaten.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

You make it so easy! Awwww.[__TREXEL:__ Yes.]Pinch that cheek. [__TREXEL:__ My cheeks.] Aww! Keep that hat on! [__TREXEL:__ Ow, ow.] Mmm.

#### TREXEL

Ow. Yes, yes, it's on.

#### HARTRO

Well, we've got one more planet to discuss. Let's do it.

Yes!__HARTRO:__ Ohhhh, some hiccups there! Several hiccups with the LavLev technology. Everything's melted, Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ Ahh.] Everything is melted. You've basically created a giant sun.

#### TREXEL

Right. That was always a bit of a risk with LavLev. I was pretty sure the people down in Build could sort that one out, but I'm guessing that's not... quite... how it...

#### HARTRO

They followed the design plans and they created what it created and, oh no! Poof! [__TREXEL:__ Everything's dead.] Everyone died in a big burst of flame. Oh! Except for the children!

#### TREXEL [gasps]

Wonderful! The children survived!

#### HARTRO

In the marmalade crèche area.

#### TREXEL

That is a big relief because after last week when I found out that I killed all those larvae, I am glad that the children survived! In, in the marmalade crèche! It worked! I've insulated them!

#### HARTRO

It did! I don't know how, but they're all there. I'm so glad that you care so much for them because, because-- Do you know what? I was trying to think, "Oh, what should I do with them? These poor little... orphans."

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Oh, well relocate them to new families, I suppose?

#### HARTRO

Yes, well, we're going to keep them in the marmalade, because that's what they know. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] But we thought I'd arrange for you to go and just spend some time with them! [__TREXEL:__ Oh, um.] Just look into the eyes of the orphans. Perhaps, entertain them, do a song and a dance.

#### TREXEL

Do they know that I'm responsible for the planet that--

#### HARTRO

Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Yes. We've got posters all around. Big lines through your face. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] It's quite clear who killed their parents. But we thought, you know, let's give you the chance to do some healing for yourself.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Can you sing? Can you dance?__TREXEL:__ I-- I-- I can sing, yes. And I've been known to dance.

#### HARTRO

I was thinking, David: can you just lay down a beat?__DAVID:__ Um...

#### TREXEL

Wh-- I-- Um--

#### HARTRO

Now come on: I'm a little orphan. Ooh! I'm in my marmalade. I hate your guts! You killed my dad!

#### IMOGEN [crosstalk] [beep]

##### [ascending beeps of the roleplay holovision turning on]

Roleplay holovision: initiated.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Uh...

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Okay, uh, give me, give me--

#### HARTRO

Entertain me.

#### TREXEL

And a-one. And a-two. And a--

#### DAVID [poorly beatboxing]

##### [this continues]

A boom, boom ba-tish. Boom-ba-toom. Boom-ba-tish...

#### TREXEL [singing]

Some things happen for a reason! Don't blame Trexel, leave him be. Your parents might have died at any point. So take that finger and please don't point at my face. Saying, "Trexel, you did it! Trexel, you killed them! My parents are dead!" Don't say it! "Trexel, you're a monster! Trexel, why could you? Trexel, you're an idiot!" He's a genius inside. So don't reside too long in this realm of hate.

#### HARTRO

Big ending! Big ending!

#### TREXEL [singing]

Forgive Trexel, for he's. Only. Doing. His. Best! Pa-chaaa! Pa-chaa! Jazz hands! Pa-cha.

#### DAVID [stops beatboxing]

Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

#### IMOGEN

##### [descending beeps of the roleplay holovision turning off]

Roleplay holovision: terminated.

#### HARTRO

Ohh, this is going to be so much better than I thought! Ooh!

#### DAVID

Um... I don't have to come to the marmalade crèche to lay down any beats, do I?

#### HARTRO

Oh, nonono. [__DAVID: [sigh of relief]__ Oh. Okay.] No, you're not allowed out of the room. No, we'll just, we'll just use that recording, [__DAVID:__ Oh, okay.] and, we'll, I don't know... We'll make it work. Yeah...

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Some sort of marmalade speaker system.

#### HARTRO

It's going to be terrible.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

So that's, so that's my weekend sorted, I suppose?

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

Yeah. Well, I thought you'd appreciate that. Just a chance to--

#### TREXEL

--chance to give something back.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

Sweet.

#### TREXEL

So, I'm-- I'm--

#### HARTRO

You're spoken for this weekend.

#### TREXEL

What time do you need me there for?

#### HARTRO

Let's say 9:00. But then, you know--

#### TREXEL

--A.M.?

#### HARTRO

Yeah, 9:00 A.M. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] And you know what they say: on time is late. So, early. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] Let's say 8:30. [__TREXEL:__ Well, as I've said--] And if you're there at 8:00... you know...

#### TREXEL

Yes. That's fine. Well, as I've said, I've turned over a new leaf. I don't want anyone else getting hurt because of my mistakes. So. I will be there.

#### DAVID

So, speaking of people getting hurt because of Trexel's mistakes: [__HARTRO:__ Hmm.] how did the review--

#### HARTRO

--Are you breathing?

#### TREXEL

You've been breathing this entire time, haven't you, David?!

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

I thought his holes were supposed to be shut.

#### TREXEL

##### [David tries to speak while holding his breath]

##### [muffled speech]

##### [muffled speech]

I-- I-- I'm pretty sure I ordered his holes to be shut. [__HARTRO:__ Hmm.] He's been, he's been huffing gas through them the entire time. Let's turn our attention away from what *I've* done, and look at David over here! Huffing away! Metabolizing sugars like an idiot!

#### HARTRO

I think we'll leave him like that: To ponder whether or not he'll live. I love it!

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro hums knowingly]

##### [Hartro hums again more exaggerated]

Yes, wonderful, wonderful. Will he live? I mean, have we... That's not--I'm sorry, Hartro, that's not really an answer. You just sort of smiled-- Well, well, right--__HARTRO:__ Oh, I'm thinking about my float tank. [__hums contentedly]__

#### TREXEL

Oh, I see, you've got a floatation tank booked.

#### HARTRO [contented sigh]

Off I go!__TREXEL: [crosstalk]__ Right, but, just--__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Line manager departing.

##### [door swooshing shut]

#### TREXEL

Well, David, I think we're alright because normally, you'd-- Oh, I didn't get those drinks tokens. Gah! I get one, one good thing from that, and that was those drinks tokens, and she walked out without them!

#### DAVID [mumbling]

C-- can-- can I breathe again, please?

#### TREXEL

Yes, David, you can breathe again.

#### DAVID [sigh of relief]

So... d-- did--

#### TREXEL

Oh, a whole weekend with orphans I've created in a marmalade crèche.

#### DAVID

So-- so is next week happening?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, next week's happening.

#### DAVID

Okay, so will I already be--

#### TREXEL

--You'll already be dead.

#### DAVID

Okay, that's--

#### TREXEL

Stop whining! Stop thinking about yourself! Think about me! I've got to spend an entire weekend looking in the faces of orphans in a marmalade-- I hate marmalade! I'm more of a jam guy.

#### DAVID [flatly]

Well, we should have designed a jam crèche then, shouldn't we, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Oh, well, yes. Wish, wish, *wish*. If wishes were horses then Trexel would ride! We haven't. We have a marmalade crèche, and I'm gonna spend all weekend in it! Maybe I'll, I don't know, hide out somewhere. See if she finds me. Oh, she won't find me. She can't find me!__DAVID: [flatly]__ She has a tracker in you.__TREXEL:__ She has a tracker in me. What if I hide *real* well? What if I, what if I bury myself deep in the mainframe? Where am I? I am but dust. Pfff. I'm gone!

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Well, as long as the mainframe's a faraday cage, then I guess you will be fine.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

A what-a-day cage?

#### DAVID

A faraday cage.

#### TREXEL

A what-a-day cage?

#### DAVID

A *faraday* cage.

#### TREXEL

What's a faraday cage?

#### DAVID

Well, it's a sort of--

#### TREXEL

I haven't got time for this! I need to go and find a place to hide. *Goodbye*, David. Think about what you've done. Don't breathe out of any of your holes until I get back!

##### [door swooshing shut]

#### DAVID [exhales]

##### [sighs]

Oh, he's gone.  Well, I'm not dead so that's a plus. And Trexel's having a miserable weekend, so that's a plus.
