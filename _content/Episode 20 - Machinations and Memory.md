#### DAVID [talking to himself]

##### [sigh]

Ohh... I hope this goes well.  I mean, it's got to go *better*... but I'll die if it goes really badly. No, it *must* be better. I'm-- I'm better than Trexel. No Trexel, no problem! I mean theoretically, not *actually,* but--

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

##### [David yelps]

David! David, look at me. I am a mole. Tunneling through the soil of creativity looking for nuggets! Nuggets, David. And do you think we found them? Do you think we've found them, David?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Yes we have, David, because we have bonded. We have improved. We have unified as a unit, and together we have-- I believe-- over the past three days, made planets of wonder.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, yes, no, we definitely have and it will definitely be down... to that! That is why these planets will please Hartro in a way which she has not been pleased before.

#### TREXEL

David, you're more glisteny than usual. [__DAVID__: What? No, no...] You know you, you always have a--

##### [door swooshes open]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Line manager arrival!

#### HARTRO

##### [David and Trexel yelp]

Hello!  Ah, review time! Hi, boys.

#### DAVID [nervously]

Hello.

#### TREXEL

How... are you, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

I'm sufficient.

#### TREXEL

Your skin... and nails?

#### HARTRO

You do not need to talk about my skin every time, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay, but I just-- you have excellent--

#### HARTRO

David-7!

#### DAVID [trying to smile]

Eeee.

#### HARTRO

Good news. You're alive.

#### DAVID

Y-- yes?

#### HARTRO

You shall continue... [__DAVID__: Ooh!] ...to exist!

#### DAVID

Yay!

#### TREXEL [shouting]

I knew it! I knew it, we're geniuses! *We're geniuses*!

#### DAVID

Right!

#### HARTRO

Okay, just pipe down there.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, I've-- I've never-- rarely been this excited, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

Alright, now what happens at the beginning of every review?

#### TREXEL

I tell you why I'm late. It's a real doozy this time! So, I was in the reactor core, elbow deep--

#### HARTRO [interrupting]

Okay, just-- just, pipe down. Can I get comfortable while he tells me?

#### DAVID

Oh yes, sorry, I'll get off this.

#### HARTRO

Just shift over, yes. And I just wouldn't mind a bit of *something*... I don't know, Trexel, a bit of something... uhm... put-- is there some sort of cushion?

#### TREXEL

D'you want my cushion, Hartro, is-- is that what's..?

#### HARTRO

*Oh*, you have a cushion? [__TREXEL:__ Yes, I have my cushion.] I wouldn't mind your cushion.

#### TREXEL

My consultant's cushion.

#### HARTRO

Thank-- thank you. Oh, thank you.

#### TREXEL

My father gave me this, but okay!

#### HARTRO

And where were you?

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay, so I'm elbow-deep in this reactor core, my hair falling out all over the--

#### HARTRO [interrupting]

The funny thing is, I-- you know what? It's-- it's the temperature in here. I feel *hot*.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Temperature is preset by Temperature Regulation Subcommittee 4 and cannot be altered.

#### HARTRO

I mean, is it just me-- David-7, are you hot?

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Umm. I'm just--

#### TREXEL

He's always... he's sweating right now.

#### HARTRO

And so the review. Let's continue, shall we?

#### TREXEL

Okay, so-- do you wanna--

#### HARTRO

I don't need to recycle David-7 today!

#### DAVID [weakly]

Yaaaay...

#### TREXEL

Excellent, excellent. And by extension, that's because I am a... genius?

#### HARTRO

It would be wrong of me to kill your dreams in such a way as to say no, but I would like to just redirect the reasoning around to the fact that maybe it was the team-building exercises.

#### DAVID

Ooh, yes! Definitely.

#### HARTRO

Did you enjoy them?

#### DAVID

Yes, and they were definitely really helpful. I-- I do hope that they made the planets better... *were* the planets better?

#### HARTRO

The planets were-- wait for it-- ...they were *slightly better*.

#### DAVID

Oh, that's very-- that's very good.

#### HARTRO

##### [various noises of agreement from David and Trexel]

You could see that each planet was built upon a team coming together [__DAVID:__ Yes.] to create... plans. And it was as if you* understood* each other... [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes!] ...and were trusting each other, as if somebody had guided you to become that way. Like me. Well done, Hartro.

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

Yes, yes, well done, Hartro!

#### TREXEL

##### [they applaud]

A round of applause for Hartro.

#### HARTRO

Thank you. Thank-- thank you.

#### TREXEL

This must be a real boon for you!

#### HARTRO

##### [laughs lightly]

Well, I mean I am  getting recognition. You know, upstairs and you know... yes, and I've-- I've received smiles from people that didn't even know my name before! [__TREXEL:__ She's at smiling level.] Things are changing for me. [__TREXEL:__ David, that's a big deal. Hartro-- you don't understand the hierarchy around here.] So, we need to keep this going. We need to keep this rolling, boys.

#### DAVID

Yes. Forever and ever and ever.

#### TREXEL

But before-- we can't get too carried away. We need to go over the planets and really luxuriate in their details, and really understand why the planets that *I* designed [__DAVID:__ Yes.] are simply the best.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Planet 1. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] For the lovely Cardinal Fang!

#### TREXEL

Cardinal *Fang*?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Cardinal Fang!

#### HARTRO

I believe they're referred to as "The Kind"?

#### DAVID

Yes, Cardinal "The Kind" Fang.

#### HARTRO

Yes, and you built them an unexpected planet.

#### TREXEL

Wait, Sorry-- Hartro-- Cardinal Fang. [__HARTRO:__ Yes?] Not a terrifying mono-being that knows all your thoughts.

#### HARTRO

No. Also referred to as the Benevolent, [__DAVID:__ Yeah, The Generous.] the Generous, the Happy-To-Clean-Your-Socks.

#### DAVID

The Full of Givitude.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

This is a nice one. Okay, well, I just-- asking for a friend, what are--

#### DAVID

We-- we discussed this. Cardinal Fang, one of the Cardinals of the Church of the Unexpected Surprise?

#### HARTRO

Trexel, do you *know* who you're building your planets for? [__TREXEL:__ Yes!] I would say that that would be possibly the first and most important thing--

#### DAVID

Well, obviously, Trexel *does* know, because the planet was designed for that.

#### HARTRO

And the input I have to give back to you is: well done.

#### DAVID

Yes Trexel, well done Trexel.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Yes, it's all coming.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

Is it coming back?

#### TREXEL

Yes, Cardinal Fang...

__HARTRO and TREXEL: [overlapping and agreeing]__ The Benevolent, Kind... the Whisperer of Dreams, yes.

#### HARTRO

They were *very* pleased. Well, first of all, you gave them an unexpected planet, with a deliciously lovely upholstered chair in the middle. [__DAVID:__ Mmhmm.] [__TREXEL:__ Really?] A nice little touch! And an unexpected ornamental cathedral!

#### TREXEL

A *cathedral*?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

A-- a cathedral.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Ye-- yes.

#### HARTRO

Well, they obviously needed a cathedral for the believers.

#### DAVID

Because the Cardinal is obviously a religious figure.

#### HARTRO

Trexel. Wake up.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, sorry--

#### HARTRO

Do you know where we are? [__TREXEL:__ Yes, absolutely, sorry--] We're on Planet 1.

#### TREXEL [quickly]

You're right. You won't hear it again from me, yes. Absolutely on board, we built a cathedral, we like the cathedral.

#### DAVID

And a garden.

#### TREXEL

And a-- and a garden?

#### DAVID

And a garden.

#### TREXEL

And also a garden.

#### DAVID

Around the cathedral.

#### HARTRO

Verdant, rolling, green garden hills, I think they mentioned here, as a particular lovely joy that they liked. [__TREXEL:__ Yes, well--] Lovely feedback. I mean, this is what I expect! This is what I normally get from my design teams. It's about time.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs, trails off]

Well, you know what they always say: you want a verdant hill, you come to Geistman. Ol' Verdant Hills Geistman! And they're not referring to my hot buns!  Everybody's looking at me.

#### HARTRO

Nobody's laughing.

#### TREXEL

No, okay, well, you know, it was worth a go. Either way, I'm-- I'm really-- I'm a real Capability Geistman.

#### HARTRO

And it's just amazing! I mean, what's changed? I mean, I want to say the team-building... so tell me it's the team-building.

#### DAVID AND TREXEL [various agreements that it was, in fact, the team-building]

#### HARTRO

Is that what's done it?

#### DAVID

Yeah, definitely. [__TREXEL:__ We've been working together.] We're teaming up.

#### HARTRO

Yes, so just explain... how did that work? Which one of my exercises were you particularly pulling upon?

#### DAVID

Uhhh.. the middle one.

#### TREXEL

Yes, that middle one.

#### HARTRO [gasp]

That one. The puppets.

#### TREXEL

The one between the other two.

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

Yes, yes.

#### HARTRO

I knew it. I knew it!

#### DAVID

It really helped us get to the bottom of our relationship with each other and earn... and-- and then when we came back from that, we were like... "Here we go. This is how we design... together."

##### [pause]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hooray for teamwork! Within guidelines.

#### TREXEL

##### [tears up]

And you know what, it also helped me really explore my complicated feelings towards puppets of myself. Because I-- I sat with that puppet, and I... I felt things that I...  Sorry, come back to me--

#### HARTRO

Are you crying, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

No, no, my eyes are just...

#### HARTRO

Trexel? [__TREXEL:__ I just--] If you're gonna cry, you look straight ahead, and you cry.

#### TREXEL

##### [loudly]

Okay, okay. Oh, god...

#### HARTRO

Trexel, you don't half-cry. You cry.

#### TREXEL

Huoaaaagh... emotions...

#### HARTRO

Have them. Have them... and stop. Lovely. So, well done on Planet 1.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful! Wonderful! You know what? I-- I--

#### HARTRO

Are you *still* crying?

#### TREXEL

It's-- a little bit, just--

#### HARTRO

Trexel, I said stop!

#### TREXEL

##### [talking to self]

##### [calm]

Sorry, hang on-- give me a moment.  Rrrgh! Pull it together, Geistman. Pull it together! Quiet! Dark... cupboards...! There it is, I'm back in the room.

#### HARTRO

Okay. Can we continue the review? [__TREXEL:__ Please.] 'Cause there's more I need to say. [__TREXEL:__ Wonderful.] Right, so. The outcome of this is Stellar Firma has now been blessed with four more orders! We have a repeat customer!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [fanfare plays]

Repeat customer logged!

#### TREXEL

Y-- yay![__DAVID: [unenthusiastic]__ Yay.] Yay, yay! I have a repeat customer! [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] This has never happened before, Hartro! I don't think it's ever happened before!

#### DAVID [sarcastic]

What? Must have been the team-building!

#### TREXEL

Yes!

#### HARTRO [pleased]

It must have been!

#### TREXEL

Must have been mean the team-building, and also my towering genius! [__DAVID:__ Yes!]Flowing over the edge like lava of hot creativity!

#### DAVID

Oh, cover me in that lava of hot creativity, I've written down your ideas and it's made a good planet!

#### TREXEL

Easy, David, let's not get weird about it. I'm sorry about that, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

##### [pause]

That's fine.  Moving swiftly on...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

Planet 2, Orren Thruul's... oh, this was *The Rebirth of the Star Marlin*!

#### TREXEL

Yes, *The Rebirth of the Star Marlin.*

#### HARTRO

##### [sigh]

I love art.

#### TREXEL

We all love art here, don't we?

#### DAVID

I have never seen an art.

#### TREXEL

Well, *we* love art. Don't we, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

I am a connoisseur.

#### TREXEL

I'm more of a... journeyman.

#### HARTRO

So you built a planet.[__TREXEL:__ Yes.]A Bijou art planet with a state-of-the-art astral maternity aquarium. I love that detail. So basically we've got a lot of really happy people watching the birth of the Star Marlin!

#### TREXEL

Can I just check something? [__HARTRO:__ Yes?] At any point is there any sort of hospital involved in this?

#### DAVID

Well, it's a maternity aquarium, which is a hospital.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, you know what, yes, that makes sense.

#### HARTRO

I mean, I think there's probably people around in case there's any sort of complications, or just you know like if you need a wetting of your upper lip...

#### DAVID

Oh no, definitely, there were-- I think about six support rooms, just to make sure. Obviously, birthing a Star Marlin is-- is quite hard.

#### TREXEL

It's a complicated process.

#### HARTRO

I know-- I know that there weren't any problems, because the Star Marlin has now, I can tell you, been born.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful.

#### DAVID

Wonderful, yes.

#### TREXEL

Is it a Star Marlin or a Star Marlin?

#### HARTRO [pleased]

It turned out to be a Star Marlin.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful! Their parents must be so happy. [__DAVID:__ Awww, that's nice!]

#### HARTRO

So they were particularly pleased with the lighting. That was very, very--

#### TREXEL

You know, it's hard to coerce a sun, but we did it. We got that, and you know, [__HARTRO:__ Sorry-- ]the time bombing--

#### HARTRO

*Sorry?*

#### TREXEL

Coerced sun?

#### DAVID

Well, we went for bioluminescent algae in the end?

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes, yes. We started with coerced sun, and then we...

#### DAVID

Yes, but then we moved onto...

#### TREXEL

Bioluminescent...

#### DAVID

Algae.

#### TREXEL

Algae. [__HARTRO:__ Because--]

#### DAVID

Locally sourced!

#### TREXEL

Locally sourced.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

That was a good choice. I mean--

#### TREXEL

It's very moody lighting, from a bioluminescent algae.

#### HARTRO

It's very moody.

#### TREXEL

It's like a teen's bedroom.

#### HARTRO

And you know that just leads me on to say... there's been repeat business requested.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [fanfare plays]

Repeat customer logged!

#### HARTRO

I mean, they want to follow this Star Marlin through their *whole* life. They don't want to miss anything. [__TREXEL:__ The life of a Star Marlin...] So what does that mean, Stellar Firma? More business? Yes?

#### DAVID

Two repeat businesses! [__TREXEL:__ Two!]For Trexel.

#### HARTRO

We could *say* Trexel, but really... [__DAVID:__ Hartro.]From behind...

#### TREXEL

For Hartro.

#### DAVID

For Hartro.

#### TREXEL

For Hartro. And-- and her team-building acumen.

#### DAVID

Yes, for Hartro's team, which *includes* Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Trexel Geistman.

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel gasps]

Orren Thruul has received an award. This is serious. It's from the art justicar.

#### TREXEL

##### [bark of laughter]

##### [shouting]

Oh, they're a harsh critic, that's a big get. I remember the art justicar actually reviewed one of my planets . The review just read '*Why?!*'

#### HARTRO

I mean, often, I wake up in the morning and I think, 'oh I'm doing a review for Trexel', and I just look at myself in the mirror, and I say, 'why?'

#### DAVID

Ooh, I know! Because you team-built him and now he's good at designing planets.

#### TREXEL

Yes, you-- you grew me like a-- like a plant. Like a very, very competent yet misunderstood plant that you team-built into a mighty bush.

#### HARTRO

##### [noises of agreement]

I *do* feel like any success that you are having now does have something to do with me. But I still feel no real connection. So, yes a plant, but maybe you're just... a soggy root?

#### TREXEL [drawn out]

I'll... take it!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Consultant design recommendation file.

#### HARTRO

And our final planet for today's review... the *piece de resistance*. I think you did end high. Henkka is pleased as punch! They are just relaxing, they feel so relieved...?

#### DAVID

Well, it was all the water, really. That's, uh... for easing joint pain.

#### HARTRO

I mean, how did you come up with that? I mean, water cycling through a body... I mean nobody even thinks of that.

#### DAVID

Well--Trexel, how did you think of that?

#### TREXEL

Well, I-- I-- I-- when I was thinking about this planet that I remember designing, I-- I was thinking when I'm in the bath, and the bath is empty and I'm fully clothed because I've fallen in, and I'm lying there, looking up at my ceiling, thinking, 'how did it come to this?' You know what gets me up? I just turn on the tap with my foot, and the water flows down my fully clothed legs and up my fully-clothed body, and just for a moment, the fabric resists the water. It's not water-resistant fabric, but it's not wet yet-- and then suddenly, it breaks down, and the water soaks through, and I'm in a full cold bath, fully clothed, and I'm thinking, 'If I was old... this would be pretty good.'

##### [pause]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sadness detected! Security alerted.

#### HARTRO

Well, you've just created a horrible image in my head, Trexel, but it was a *beautiful* planet! It still is! I mean, the way that it cycles through the universe with such speed, and that need to bounce, just...

#### TREXEL

Just bouncing all over the... cycling through...

#### DAVID

From solar system to solar system.

#### TREXEL ...

Right.

#### HARTRO

Well, it's something about the ever-jumping quality between solar system to solar system that has that effect on the joints.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Well, it's the fluctuations of gravity, [__HARTRO:__ That's right!] and obviously the jumping from solar system-- as long as the maths is done right, and it's calculated very precisely-- is the best way to achieve that without expensive machinery and a lot of overhead! Obviously.

#### HARTRO

So, *so* scientific!

#### DAVID [overlapping]

Yes, really! Yep.

#### TREXEL [uncertainly]

Was-- was the maths right?

#### HARTRO

Oh, yes! The way that you manage to keep it at just that nice, warm temperature...

#### TREXEL

Well, of-- of course, you know, when-- when Geistman builds a planet, that's a keeper.

#### DAVID

I saw you crunch those numbers, and woo! Were those numbers crunched.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I-- I crunched through them like I crunched through my morning breakfast cubes. Crunch crunch crunch...

#### HARTRO

And isn't that interesting, that somehow the breakfast cubes that are retaining that heat, in that planet?

#### TREXEL

Yes, who would have thought we could repurpose the cubes that we all need for breakfast, for sustenance, could also be an excellent insulator? Who would have thought that?

#### DAVID

Well, obviously you!

#### TREXEL

Obviously-- obv-- yeah, me, that-- that's who I-- sorry, I didn't finish that. Let me try that again. Who would have thought of that? Aha! It was a trick. The answer is me, Trexel Geistman, because I'm a genius.

#### DAVID

Well done... Trexel and Hartro. And also Trexel, but actually Hartro? But yes, Trexel. Everyone, well done, everyone who is here.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Well, I feel like I need to just say something slightly terrible to you, Trexel, because--

#### TREXEL [shouting]

Oh, there it is, there it is! I thought it was going well and now with the-- and then the *knife* comes out, and it plunges into my body![__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Knife detected! Security alerted.] Who's died? What's exploded? Why am I in trouble? Hartro, please, I'm sorry! Please, look, pl-- I'll put all of your feet in my mouth!

#### HARTRO [mild surprise]

Okay. I mean, I was just going to say, you know, 'try not to come in drunk', or, you know, 'get here earlier', or... 'you might need another tracker soon', but... let's just do the feet! Let's do the feet.

#### TREXEL

##### [voice muffled by foot]

Right. Feet in. Okay. Here we are. Couldn't have just kept my mouth shut, could I,-- okay--

#### HARTRO

And I believe... David-7, did he say *both* feet this time?

#### DAVID

I think he did, yes.

#### TREXEL [muffled noises of protest]

#### HARTRO

I mean, it *was* special request.

##### [second foot inserted, sounds as weird as it is]

#### DAVID

Well done, Trexel.

#### HARTRO

I think we need to just- Trexel, how do you feel about doing an okay review?

#### TREXEL [muffled sounds of affirmation]

#### DAVID

I think he liked it.

#### HARTRO

Did he? He looks sad, though...

#### DAVID

Must be tears of joy coming out of his face.

#### HARTRO [gasps]

Trexel, I'm so happy that I could get you here. I feel like, as a line manager, this is the sort of day that I strive for.

#### TREXEL [unintelligible]

#### HARTRO

I appreciate me too.

#### TREXEL [muffled]

*Yes, can I take your foot out of my mouth?*

#### HARTRO

##### [protestations from Trexel]

##### [feet removal sounds]

*"Can I take a sick day off?*" No, sorry, there's no such thing as a sick day off. Sorry. Let's take those out. There we go. Now, I do *not* enjoy that, but I know how valuable you find it.

#### TREXEL

...right, you *don't* enjoy that?

#### HARTRO

No, I just know that it seems to produce quality work.

#### DAVID

Part of the process.

#### HARTRO [

__crosstalk____]__ Yeah, part of the process...

#### DAVID

As you said, part of the design process is... sometimes messy. And involves feet... in... mouths!

#### TREXEL

Thank you, David. Thank you very much. Yes, yes. Well-- well, what a-- what a strong review that was! I mean-- I mean, quite-- quite *alarmingly* strong, and so many bits I had to be reminded of! But that's old-- that's old Trexel Geistman, old-- old "Hole in the Brain" Geistman, they used to shout at me! "Where's his brain?"

#### HARTRO

Wha-- wha-- right there, Trexel, just hold on a minute. I'm just gonna grab my things and go before you have your monologue. [__TREXEL:__ Okay. Okay.]All right. Boys, carry on, do what you're doing, and [__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Line manager departing.] don't get complacent. Bye-o!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Bye, Hartro!

#### DAVID

##### [to Trexel]

B-- bye. Bye. Remember when you got into that vent and forgot what you were doing over the weekend? And the other times you forget when to come into work?

#### TREXEL

Yes, but there's something-- there's something strange about this.

#### DAVID

Is it?

#### TREXEL

David, I'm incredibly happy. Incredibly happy, unbelievably happy! This is-- this is a really *strong* review! And you're still alive, which is fine, I suppose, and I just-- but I normally don't forget *this much*, normally I *know* when I've forgotten something. There's a blank or a black but this--

#### DAVID [as though he's had an idea]

After the team-building exercise, did you go on a bender?

#### TREXEL

I suppose I did go on a bit of a bender, and I did drink all that moisturiser, and that can't be good for me. That's something I haven't done before.

#### DAVID

Maybe you've got the-- the moisture holes.

#### TREXEL

Maybe I've got moisture holes in my brain.__ ...__Well, I'll go down to medical and see what they can do, but you know, I think the big takeaway here is, while I do have a gnawing knot of suspicion that *something's* wrong in the very pit of my stomach-- right now? Right now? It's time to celebrate.

#### DAVID

Good review.

#### TREXEL

Good review.

#### DAVID

Well done, Trexel. You... we'll see you on... Monday.

#### TREXEL

Yes. *Probably* see me on Monday.

#### DAVID

Oh-- hey, just relax, maybe! It seems maybe this, uh... more relaxed attitude you're taking to your work is-- is doing well. You know, maybe just take it easy. You deserve a good weekend of rest and relaxation. [__TREXEL:__ Thank you.] 'Cause you did so well.

#### TREXEL

Thank you, David. [__DAVID:__ With those planets.] I don't think-- I don't think I maybe say this enough, but I-- I know we obviously gave Hartro a lot of credit for the team-building, but... you and I both know that... what's really changed is... well, how close we've become.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [awkwardly]

You *are* still a tool! You know, that's-- that's something we can't get away from. You're a clone. Clones aren't friends. Friends aren't clones. You can't have clone friends. "Send that clone away, he's no friend of my son. You're not allowed to love a clone, Trexel, you idiot. Get in the box!" You know, that's-- that's the rule. But, uh... yeah. I'll see you on Monday.

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

##### [pleased]

Okay. Bye! Oof! *Nailed* it.
