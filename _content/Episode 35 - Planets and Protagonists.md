#### TIM

Hi there, it's Tim "Captain Bigtime" Meredith. This week, I'd like to extend a very special thanks to our outgoing lead editor, David Devereux. David has been with us for some time now and done some excellent work. However, he's now moving on to new projects. Something about wanting to see the sun again. I wasn't really listening. In his place, I'd like to welcome our new lead editor, Maddy Searle. May the Board preserve and keep her.

#### HARTRO

##### [David startles]

Hello!  Hello-- Oh! Ooh, atmosphere in here. Oooooh.

#### DAVID

What? No.

#### HARTRO

What happened?

#### DAVID

Nothing.

#### TREXEL

Nothing happened, Hartro. We-we're fine. Everybody's *fine*. Everybody's had a lovely time and nobody--

#### HARTRO

Have you ever been fine, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I was fine once. I remember. It was about 7 or 8 cycles ago and they forgot I existed, and I lived, you know, in a, in a--

#### DAVID

Yep, he was fine and then something happened, and he took it out on everybody else.

#### HARTRO

Ooooh, ooh, ooh oooh.

#### TREXEL

O-okay. Okay, well why don't we pack that attitude right up!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Employees must pay for extra attitude storage.

#### HARTRO

You know, this is great. [__DAVID:__ Fine.] You've had a, [__DAVID:__ Fine.] you've had a falling out. I can tell.

#### TREXEL

We've had a fine-ing out.

#### DAVID

Yeah, we're fine.

__TREXEL and DAVID:__ We're so fine.

#### DAVID

It's all fined up.

#### TREXEL

It's all fine.

#### HARTRO

Well, good. It's fine. Great. That is fine.

#### TREXEL

Like, like, like the sandpaper you'd use to really finish a piece of furniture, it's very fine.

#### HARTRO

Boys... we're gonna play a game.

#### DAVID

What?

#### HARTRO

Yep, we're playing a game.

#### DAVID

Oh. Uh...

##### [Trexel sighs]

#### HARTRO

We're playing a game *together*. All of us.

#### TREXEL

Why? Why are we bothering with these games?

#### HARTRO

Because-- we are learning. You are becoming better s-- Well, you're not. I'm trying to help foster your salesmanship. Okay?

#### TREXEL

Our salesmanship?

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I'm a good salesman.

#### HARTRO

Trexel.

#### TREXEL

I don't need help. It's him. It's him! It's he!

#### DAVID

What, me?

#### TREXEL

It's he, the slimy clone boy over there!

#### DAVID

Me? No, it's just your-- all your, all your lying, lie lessons about lying!

#### HARTRO

Okay, can y--

#### TREXEL

Meh, meh!

#### HARTRO

Right, you two you can just fight over--

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### TREXEL

Fine.

#### HARTRO

--fight over there. I need to set some things up, okay? So I'm just gonna bring this--

#### DAVID

Okay, right.

#### HARTRO

I have a trolley.

#### TREXEL

Have you got a-- Is that a dress-up box?

#### HARTRO

##### [rattle]

It's, it's something. You'll see.  Right, so I'm just gonna lay this out here--

#### DAVID

##### [reading]

What is that?  "Planets and Protagonists"?

#### TREXEL

This--

#### HARTRO

This-- Well, just pull a chair up around the--

##### [chair scrapes]

#### TREXEL

##### [grunts]

Right.

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### HARTRO

--the table here.

#### TREXEL

This s-- this seems really in depth all of a sudden.

#### DAVID

What are these strange cubes?

##### [dice clatter together]

#### HARTRO

Those, those are dice, David 7.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

D6 dice detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Dice?

#### HARTRO

Instruments of learning.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

What, what are we doing here, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

What, you want me to explain? I will explain. I'm trying to set it up. Just--

#### DAVID

Are those little figurines?

##### [figurines clatter]

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, how have you had time to prep-- all of the people that you must be dealing with and managing with, why is, why does it feel like you turn up and this is just all, all for us?

#### DAVID

This one looks like me in a funny hat.

#### TREXEL

That one looks like me also in a hat that is funny!

#### HARTRO

Don't-- Gentle! Gentle! These are important. And I... have... more time to spend with you. The, the-- Stellar Firma thought, you know, it would be good if I spent a little bit more time on just you two. So I'm spending--

#### TREXEL

How much more time?

#### HARTRO

Just more time with this particular sales team.

#### TREXEL

But, but how, how m-- What I'm sort of saying, [__HARTRO:__ More--] Hartro, is how much more?

#### HARTRO

I'm spending time on you, Trexel! Stop. It's my job to interrogate. Questions no more.

#### TREXEL

Okay. No more questions from ooooold Trexel Geistman.

#### HARTRO

You forget yourself! You forget yourself.

#### TREXEL

Sorry. I'm sorry, Hartro. I just... I'm getting very stressed--

#### HARTRO

##### [cape swooshes]

Now when I wear this cape--

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

That is a-- that is a bespoke cape.

#### DAVID

That's a lot of stars on that cape.

#### TREXEL

That's a fancy cape. I want that cape.

#### HARTRO

That's my-- it's my cape.

#### DAVID

That's gold trim.

#### HARTRO

It's-- it is for the guide. So, from now on, I'd like you to call me Ortrah.

#### TREXEL

Ortrah.

#### DAVID

Ortrah.

#### HARTRO

Ortrah.

#### DAVID

O-ortrah.

#### TREXEL

Ortrah. Is that Hartro backwards?

#### HARTRO

Trexel! Do *not* forget yourself or I will remind you.

#### TREXEL

I apologise, Ortrah. You are all powerful and all knowing.

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

Incorrect.

#### HARTRO

##### [Ortrah voice]

Right.  "So, what we have before us--" This is my Ortrah voice. Ortrah.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### HARTRO

"What we have--"

#### DAVID

Am I still David?

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

Am I still Trexel?

#### HARTRO

If you would just--

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro sighs]

Ortrah, we beseech you for knowledge!  Who are we?!

#### HARTRO

"Ortrah will make all clear soon. You are"--Trexel--"you--"

#### TREXEL

I know I'm Trexel. Hello!

#### HARTRO

No! "You are Chauncey, the--"

#### TREXEL

I'm what now?

#### HARTRO

"Chauncey--"

#### TREXEL

Chauncey.

#### HARTRO

##### [puts figurine on the board]

"--here's your figurine."

#### TREXEL

Oh, excellent.

#### HARTRO

"You are a traveling merchant. And you--"

#### TREXEL

I'm a, I'm a salesperson.

#### HARTRO

"You're a traveling merchant. Listen to Ortrah."

#### DAVID

##### [bitter]

A traveling merchant is a salesperson,  Tre-- Sorry, Chauncey!

#### TREXEL

How would you know, "I don't know your name yet David 7".

#### HARTRO

"This is--"

#### DAVID

It's David.

#### HARTRO

"Th--"

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I know but you--  you're about to be given a name!

#### DAVID

David.

#### HARTRO

"This is Lambert the 7th."

#### DAVID

L-- What?!

#### TREXEL

Lambert. Lambert the 7th.

#### DAVID

Lambert?

#### TREXEL

Lambert.

#### HARTRO

"You're Lambert the 7th."

#### DAVID

Lambert.

#### HARTRO

"Yes."

#### TREXEL

What a stupid name.

#### DAVID

What if I wanted to be called David instead?

#### HARTRO

You can't be.

#### DAVID

Um...

#### HARTRO

David.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

I don't know who David is. I am Lambert.

#### HARTRO

Thank you. See that's the spirit. Lambert--

#### TREXEL

Chauncey remembered his name really quickly.

#### HARTRO

"Lambert the 7th and you--"

#### DAVID

Lambert's gonna be better at this than Chauncey.

#### TREXEL

##### [childish]

Oh, eh.

#### HARTRO

"And you, Lambert the 7th, are in charge of merchandise. So, you are in charge of taking care of the wares that Chauncey, the traveling merchant, is going to sell."

#### TREXEL

My assistant.

#### DAVID

You've-- I'm--

#### TREXEL

My lowly assistant.

#### HARTRO

"Head of, head of merchandise."

#### DAVID

Head! Head of merchandising!

#### TREXEL

Am I, am I head of merchanting?

#### DAVID

No, you're the *foot* of salespeople.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

No, no, no, I am a--

#### DAVID

You are the bum of selling things!

#### TREXEL

I, uh-- Ortia, Ortia. Actually, I think you'll find that Lambert is, is subservient--

#### HARTRO

No, it's Ortrah!

#### TREXEL

O-ortrah.

#### HARTRO

My name-- "my name is Ortrah."

#### TREXEL

Ortrah.

#### HARTRO

"I am your benevolent guide here on Orb 9, which is the orbit where we are."

#### DAVID

We're in-- we're in orbit--

#### TREXEL

We're on Orb 9 so Chauncey--

#### HARTRO

You're on--

#### DAVID

No, we're in Stellar Firma.

#### HARTRO

No, excuse me-- "Lambert the 7th we are in Orb 9--"

#### DAVID

I'm Davi-- No! I'm... yeah.

#### HARTRO

"--and you have been sent from your floating planet in the sky by Fella Termis. He sent you here to sell--"

#### DAVID

Who is this Fella?

#### TREXEL

Fella Termis.

#### HARTRO

"--sell-- sell your wares on Orb 9. So you need to sell your wares."

#### DAVID

Is this not all just a bit silly?

#### TREXEL

Yes, good question. Is this not *really* stupid?

#### HARTRO

##### [sighs] [upset]

Okay, the next person that interrupts my game is going to get... beaten!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Yikes!

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### HARTRO

Beat-en!

#### DAVID

Uh--

#### HARTRO

With *things*!

#### DAVID

Yes, Ortrah.

#### TREXEL

Yes, yes Ortrah.

#### HARTRO

##### [silence]

I will throw the dice at you! And I will make them embed in you.  Thank you. Right. Ortrah. Now, where was I?

#### TREXEL

We were on Orb 9.

#### HARTRO

"Oh, yeah. On Orb 9. And your duty is to sell your wares. Um, you also have an inventory in your satchel which, Lambert the 7th, you carry."

#### DAVID

Oh, 'cause I'm head of merchandising.

#### HARTRO

"Yes."

#### TREXEL

Yeah, you're the carrier.

#### DAVID

So, I've got all the merchandise, so if I don't give--

#### TREXEL

Would you-- I--

#### DAVID

##### [louder, petulant]

--if I don't Chauncey any merchandise, he won't have anything to sell!

#### HARTRO

"Y--"

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro shakes dice]

##### [Hartro throws die and hits Trexel]

Yes, well if I didn't give Lambert a job, Lambert would have been surplussed through requirements and surely killed in a pit.  Oh, no!  Ow! Ow, ow, I've had a die thrown at me.

#### HARTRO

I did warn you. Now focus. And no more outbursts!

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### HARTRO

##### [whispering]

##### [getting upset]

I haven't even gotten to the game yet. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] I'm just trying to tell you how we're starting, okay? [__TREXEL:__  David.] It's just simple. [__TREXEL:__ David. David.] I spent some time on this, [__TREXEL:__ David, I think--]  and I want to play the game. [__TREXEL:__ David.] Okay? Playing the game, okay!

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

##### [Hartro takes a deep breath]

David, I think we should, I think we should try.  She's getting quite... agitated. I think we should just try and go along with this as best we can, okay?

#### DAVID

Fine.

#### TREXEL

##### [whispers]

Good, okay, fine.

#### HARTRO

##### [chuckles]

"Inside your satchel, you will find that you have your wares and you also have some rags to polish them. And you have... six signed photos of the intergalactic philanthropist and all 'round hottie, Bathin."

#### DAVID

Oooooooooh! Bathin!

#### HARTRO

I just threw those in 'cause I...

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Bathin is yum.

#### HARTRO

I don't know. I...

##### [Trexel sighs deeply]

#### DAVID

I like them. I think they're very good. They are our prized possessions.

#### TREXEL

Right, we're, we're--

#### DAVID

Lambert likes to stick them around the place for *all* of the people to see. Then he takes them down and rag-polishes them again so they're all very shiny.

#### TREXEL

Chauncey, Chauncey feels like maybe... maybe he's overrated but fine, you know, that's my wares, so fine. Fine. I'm selling them. I'm selling them.

#### DAVID

They are the most expensive things in our inventory.

#### TREXEL

##### [agitated]

Fine! Okay, fine. Alright.

#### DAVID

And they're very popular.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Good.

#### HARTRO

Right. "So, we begin--"

#### TREXEL

Is that all we've got?

#### HARTRO

"Yes. Your wares and your--"

#### TREXEL

With-- We are traveling around Orb 9 with 6 signed copies of--

#### HARTRO

"And your wares!"

#### DAVID

And our wares.

#### HARTRO

"And your wares."

#### TREXEL

Oh, we have further wares.

#### HARTRO

"Yes. And rags to polish them. I will present you with... challenges which you need to overcome and sell your wares. Always--"

#### DAVID

And this, this will help us--

#### HARTRO

Sell.

#### DAVID

--sell.

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

We, we sell in fiction and we sell in life!

#### DAVID

Okay. No, fine. This makes complete sense.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Of course it does.

#### DAVID

Yes. No, I was agreeing with you very wholeheartedly. Um, look. Yes, Ortrah, um, what are the other things of the game?

#### HARTRO

##### [nonsense noises]

Well, so, you can solve it by your entrepreneurship, okay? So, like, selling and... advertising and . You know? Or you can sell it through compliance. So, how well you go by the rules, and how well you follow the order of the universe.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### HARTRO

Um, also, you can do things like run, jump--

#### TREXEL

Punch?

#### HARTRO

Punch.

#### TREXEL

We can punch?

#### HARTRO

Yes, maybe.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Trexel does do that quite a lot in [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] to the clients, so...

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Punching is for closers.

#### HARTRO

##### [stammers]

That brings me to the fact that Chauncey's character has quite  medium, I'll give you a 2 for your calisthenicals.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay, so I can, I can do a punch but, after a while, I'm a bit tired.

#### HARTRO

But your, you know, your compliance isn't so good, Chaunc--

#### TREXEL

##### [laughs]

No. No, it's not.

#### DAVID

Yeah, that scans.

#### HARTRO

So that's a 1.

#### TREXEL

No.

#### HARTRO

And your entrepreneurship--

#### TREXEL

Is a million.

#### HARTRO

--I'll, I'll give you a 3 'cause I had to put a 3.

#### TREXEL

##### [offended]

3?!

#### HARTRO

I had to put it somewhere.

#### TREXEL

Could I have 4?

#### DAVID

Could you just give him another 1?

#### TREXEL

No. No, no, I--

#### HARTRO

No, I-- it, it would ruin the game. But I could-- It would ruin the game.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Alright, 3. So, 3's the best though 'cause--

#### HARTRO

Lambert.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

-- 3's the best. I just want to say, 3's the best.

#### HARTRO

Yeah, but Lambert has a 3 as well.

##### [David laughs gloatingly]

#### TREXEL

In what?! In what?

#### HARTRO

In comp-- in compliance! Alright.

#### DAVID

##### [smug]

I know all the rules. I'm very good at the rules. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] Like when the beeper goes off, and the flashing thing does a flash, I know all about them.

#### HARTRO

So that's your strongest one. You're medium one is entrepreneurship.

##### [Hartro and Trexel mutter]

#### DAVID

Yeah, I'm always pretty good at that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

#### HARTRO

And your last is your calisthenicals. Not the--

#### TREXEL

You weak little worm.

#### DAVID

Well... I don't walk much.

#### TREXEL

You're a wobbly, little worm.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Wobble worm detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

I am quite wobbly.

#### HARTRO

So, let's play.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Enhanced roleplay holovision initiated. Oooooooh!

##### [enhanced electronic powering on sound]

##### [organ music playing in background]

#### TREXEL

Oh, okay.

#### DAVID

Um...

#### HARTRO

I've brought you something to wear.

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh...

#### TREXEL

Ooh, is, is this a jerkin?

#### DAVID

And I have a little... little sort of, a bit of a hat and a bit of a beard. I just guess I'll put this on.

#### TREXEL

Sort of all-in-one.

#### DAVID

Yeah, I'll just pop this over my--

#### TREXEL

There's just a beard attached to the hat.

#### DAVID

--my hat.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Okay.

#### TREXEL

What, we just, we just treat it like life.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

This is, this is your new, this is your life. This is real.

#### DAVID

Real. Okay.

#### HARTRO

This is real.

#### TREXEL

This is real.

#### HARTRO

Okay, so--

#### DAVID

##### [wagon wheels squeaking, horse walking]

Wait. Uh, could I start?  Do we have to do voices?

#### TREXEL

Yes, that's involved. Do we have--

#### DAVID

Yeah, you're Ortrah--

#### HARTRO

Yes. I-- "I have a voice. In Ortrah."

#### TREXEL

Ortrah has a voice.

#### HARTRO

"Yeah, you-- Lambert--" Oh! I forgot the best bit! Oh, okay. Chauncey, anytime you touch alcohol it turns to water.

##### [David laughs maniacally]

#### TREXEL

I don't want to-- I don't want to play this game.

#### HARTRO

This is your special ability. You don't know how it might help you. It might help you.

##### [Trexel sighs]

#### DAVID

Such a special ability.

#### TREXEL

I don't like--

#### DAVID

All of those water cocktails--

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

I just--

#### DAVID

--Chauncey enjoys.

#### HARTRO

And Lambert the 7th.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### HARTRO

##### [thwap]

Alright, let me do my Ortrah voice. "Lambert the 7th, you also have a special ability. Whenever you think of a sock, it appears."  See! See look!

#### TREXEL

Oh, what a power.

#### DAVID

##### [thwap]

No! No, I didn't think of a sock!

#### TREXEL

What a little power that is.

#### HARTRO

Oh, sock.

#### DAVID

No, I didn't. I didn't think of a sock!

#### TREXEL

Socks socks sock for Lambert.

##### [thwap, thwap]

#### DAVID

##### [thwap]

No, no. No socks.  There are no socks here.

#### TREXEL

##### [David stammers]

Oh, o-our wagon is piled with socks from all the socks you've been thinking about.  I can barely see our wares.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

##### [wet splat of socks]

No, I,  I push them all out the back of the wagon and they all, they fall in a horrible puddleand die! They're all dead socks.

#### TREXEL

##### [gear shift to park]

##### [wagon stops]

Oh, apolog-- I apologise, I apologise, Lambert, we're going to have to stop the cart  and pick up all of the socks.  I get out of the cart and quickly and efficiently pick up all the socks and put them into the back of the wagon.

#### DAVID

Oh yes, well, um, it's, it's such a shame that all of the fluid on this planet, on Orb 9, is actually vodka. But every time you try to drink from a puddle, turns out it's just dirty scum water.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

This appears to be going suboptimally.

##### [music starts to distort then clicks off]

#### HARTRO

Okay. I am going to throw dice.

#### DAVID

Uh... is that a good thing?

#### HARTRO

Yeah. Do not flinch. Just receive the blow.

#### DAVID

##### [sad]

##### [winces]

Oh.

##### [Hartro throws dice]

#### TREXEL

Ow!

#### DAVID

Oh!

##### [dice clatter]

#### HARTRO

Stop talking while I'm trying to do my game. [__DAVID:__ They're really sharp.] I spent a lot of time on this and you're just going on and on and on and jabber jabber jabber. I haven't even put you on the planet yet! I've just told you about it.

#### DAVID

Oh, so we don't have a wagon?

#### TREXEL

No, I just--

#### DAVID

Wait, so there aren't any socks?

#### TREXEL

Yet.

##### [music clicks back on]

#### HARTRO

##### [moves figurine on board, crowd noises in background]

"Hello. I'm Ortrah. Welcome to Orb 9. I heard that you've traveled from far away to sell your wares. Come, Chauncey and Lambert the 7th, down my waggerly road. Oh, do do, do do. Ooh! Look it. This is the center square!  You need to get a market stall in the center square. But, oh! Big John John won't let you unless you impress him. How will you impress Big John John?"

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, I think, I think I'll take point on this--

#### DAVID

What's your voice?

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro laughs]

"I think I'll take point on this one, Lambert. I--  I'm--" What? What? What?! I'm doing, I'm doing an, an impressive voice.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Impressive is a relative perception.

#### HARTRO

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [yells in regular voice]

##### [whispers]

"I'm going to impress, uh, I'm going to impress John John with my entrepreneurial skills by presenting a business case as to why I, Chauncey,"  *greatest and mightiest of all the merchants of the stars* [__DAVID:__  Do the voice. Do the voice.] *sh*-- "all the merchants of the stars will have the best market stall there ever has been so I want to do a presentation."

#### HARTRO

"Okay, you get to--"

#### TREXEL

"I've got a 3, a 3--"

#### HARTRO

"--roll 3. Okay."

##### [shakes dice]

#### TREXEL

"Okay, 3 dice for entrepreneurship. Okay."

#### HARTRO

"Here we go."

##### [rolls dice]

#### TREXEL

"Right, I rolled two 6's and a 2."

#### HARTRO

"Ooh! Chauncey, that's so good."

#### TREXEL

"So, my presentation works really well."

#### HARTRO

"Yes, it was the best presentation that Big John John's ever seen and he--"

#### DAVID

Really?!

#### HARTRO

"--he falls over dead."

#### TREXEL

##### [John John cries out and then falls down dead]

"Oh, John John! John John, no!"

#### DAVID

Yeah, that usually--

#### TREXEL

"John John, you had so much to live for!"

#### DAVID

Usually happens when Trexel tries to do anything.

#### HARTRO

"But Big John John's wife comes up and says you can--"

#### TREXEL

"Uh, oh--"

#### HARTRO

##### [Big John John's wife voice]

Oh, I'll do her.  "You can have Big John John's stall and here's a glass of wine to celebrate."

#### TREXEL

##### [water gurgling sound]

Oh, thank you! I just bring that to my lips.

#### HARTRO

Oh, it's water.

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro laughs]

It's turned to water.  Wha--?!

#### DAVID

"Looks like it's happened again, Chauncey."

#### TREXEL

Is that, is that your Lambert voice?

#### DAVID

"What? Yes."

#### TREXEL

You're gonna do that-- isn't that going to become grating and irritating for everyone involved?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Glass houses detected. Careful now.

#### DAVID

"What do you mean? I've got a very nice voice."

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel sighs]

David 7--  I mean, uh, La-- Never mind. It, it works. It'll work.

#### TREXEL

##### [glass shatters]

Right, okay. Well, I, I now-- I, I throw my now useless glass of water onto the floor and  I say, "thank you kind market woman. I apologise for murdering your husband with the force of my skills."

#### HARTRO

"But the presentation was so good that she's just happy to have you there selling your wares."

#### DAVID

"Prithee, nice lady. Was your husband perchance a clone?"

##### [long beat]

#### HARTRO

Um... "You, you can r-- you can roll a dice to see if he was a clone!"

#### DAVID

"But, but it was just a question."

#### TREXEL

It's just a question.

#### HARTRO

Oh... I make the rules!

#### TREXEL

Sorry.

#### DAVID

Um, I know. Okay. Yes.

#### HARTRO

He's rolling a dice!

#### TREXEL

Lambert, roll a dice. Roll a dice.

#### DAVID

Um, well, uh, f-finding things out are, is, is very r-rules make-ny.

#### HARTRO

Yes. "Yes, it is."

#### DAVID

So I'm going to roll compliance!

#### HARTRO

"That's only--"

##### [dice shake]

#### DAVID

3!

#### HARTRO

"No no no no no. Oh... Let's do 1 though because it was just a question."

#### DAVID

What? Wait, what--?

#### HARTRO

"So, if you--"

#### DAVID

Wouldn't that make it harder?

#### HARTRO

"It's a question and you only get to roll 1 die if it's a question. [__DAVID:__ But my--] Don't forget your voice."

#### TREXEL

It feels like the rules are changing.

#### DAVID

##### [rolls die]

Well, I'm going to try and follow the rules, I suppose. I'm rolling one dice, so. "I do some press-ups to try and impress the John John lady's wife and I do it with a  2."

#### HARTRO

Ooooh. Oh.

#### DAVID

Is that good?

#### HARTRO

"Oh, poor Lambert the 7th."

#### TREXEL

I think you'll find it's a failure.

#### DAVID

What?!

#### HARTRO

The lady says, "whatever you do, don't think about a sock."

#### DAVID

##### [thwap]

What?  Oh, I'm not thinking--

#### HARTRO

Oh, uh!

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

##### [thwap]

##### [thwap, thwap, thwap]

Oh! Oh, and there's a sock! "Oh, look. Lambert, Lambert, you know your condition! Stop thinking about socks. We can't sell any more socks."

#### DAVID

"What condition, Chauncey? The condition of being better than you?"

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

"No, the condition of thinking about socks and making  them exist."

#### DAVID

"Well, __[____thwap]__ uh, eh! I can make infinite matter, so that's great."

#### TREXEL

Ah, I try and find a bar.

#### HARTRO

Uh--

#### DAVID

"What are you looking for, a library full of *water*?"

#### HARTRO

##### [door closes and locks, background sounds turn to birds chirping]

"There are so many socks that the two young adventurers get kicked out of the center square.  And they mosey--"

#### DAVID

Well, did-- didn't we just get a stall?

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Yes, but, but you ruined it with all your socks!

#### HARTRO

##### [crosstalk]

Yeah, but then you made too many socks.

#### DAVID

What? You said that I did socks!

#### HARTRO

Well, if you could just stop--

#### DAVID

You made me make socks!

#### HARTRO

You keep thinking about them. __[crosstalk____]__ I'm not saying you had to think about them.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

##### [thwap]

##### [thwap]

I'm not thinking of any socks.  I'm not thinking of any socks.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

"Stop thinking about socks, Lambert."

#### HARTRO

##### [thwap]

There you are now!

#### DAVID

##### [thwap]

##### [thwap]

David 7 is not thinking of socks!  Lambert the 7th is not thinking about socks!  He's thinking about... flowers.

#### TREXEL

Ortrock.

#### HARTRO

"It's Ortrah."

#### TREXEL

Sorry. Ortak. I don't like--

#### HARTRO

"Ortrah!"

#### TREXEL

Ortrah. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

You should be.

#### TREXEL

I'm really sorry, Hartro.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Honestly, it's not that hard.

#### HARTRO

"Ortrah."

#### TREXEL

I'm sorry, Ortrah-a.

#### HARTRO

"Follow me down this wobbly trail and I'll lead you to a place to wet your whistle."

##### [footsteps on gravel]

#### TREXEL

Oh, good! Oh, wonderful. Wonderful. That's what I've been-- "That's what I've been waiting for on this world. Says I, Chauncey."

#### DAVID

"I-is it called the Watering Hole?"

#### HARTRO

"It's called The Universe's End. It's a pub."

#### TREXEL

##### [background noise changes to a pub]

Wonderful. I, I walk into the pub  confidently and decree, "it is I, Chauncey, merchant venturer and captain of industry, and I demand vittles!"

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Lambert says, "Chauncey, isn't it our job, 'cause you might have forgotten about your job--you probably turned up to it late or just *ignored* it for absolutely no reason except that you're a selfish person--"

#### TREXEL

##### [shakes dice]

I use my calisthenics to pick up a chair and *smash* Lambert across the head with it.  I've got 2 in calisthenics.

#### DAVID

Isn't that against the rules? Is that not against the rules?

#### TREXEL

I've got 2 in calisthenics and I'm going to roll. Alright?

#### HARTRO

Well, let's just-- "Ortrah says yes."

##### [rolls dice]

#### TREXEL

I've got a 5 and a 3 so I think that's a success! [__DAVID:__ Um--] I pick up a chair and smash it across Lambert's stupid head.

#### DAVID

No, uh--

##### [chair smashes]

#### HARTRO

##### [David stammers]

"Lambert the 7th receives a heavy blow to the head...  with no way to defend himself except to think of a..."

#### DAVID

...Cake.

#### HARTRO

Oh, Board.

#### TREXEL

A sock, you fool.

#### HARTRO

A sock!

#### DAVID

##### [thwap]

Oh, well, now I'm thinking of a sock.

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

"Oh, look!"

#### HARTRO

##### [thwap]

"Oh!"

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

##### [socks keep appearing]

"Oh, there's so many socks now filling this  tavern.  Would anybody care to purchase this dearth of socks?" I'm using my entrepreneurship to sell the dearth of socks.

#### DAVID

Wait-- Are we just-- are we just forgetting that you hit me over the head with a chair?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

You're unconscious. No one cares about you.

#### DAVID

I, I try and get--

#### HARTRO

"Lambert the 7th lies unconscious on the floor."

#### DAVID

##### [socks stop]

What? I'm just unconscious now.

#### HARTRO

"A beautiful barmaid appears behind the counter."

#### TREXEL

I sidle up to her and say, "Hey there, chicken. Want to dance?"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

What even was that? Security alerted.

#### HARTRO

Remember, you're supposed to be trying to sell things to her as well.

#### TREXEL

"Want to dance with a value sock collection?" And I, I try and sell the socks with my entrepreneurship.

#### HARTRO

Okay, so-- Oh, entrepreneur-- You're gonna try for the 3 again?

#### TREXEL

Well, yes. [__HARTRO:__ Ah.] I-- look, I'm going to play to my strengths. You know, I, I'm a salesman. I'm selling things.

#### HARTRO

Are you gonna-- But how-- ex-- You can't just say entrepreneurship like that, like that covers everything like an "umbrella. You have to describe what you're doing."

#### TREXEL

Okay. Okay. Uh, so-- Okay. Right. So Chauncey, Chauncey leans on the bar reaching towards a glass of brandy.

#### DAVID

Am I still unconscious?

#### HARTRO

"Oh, no. No, you're back. You can come back."

#### DAVID

Oh, brilliant! I'm gonna try and get Chauncey arrested.

#### HARTRO

"Okay--"

#### TREXEL

Wh-- I-I'm trying to sell to this, to this barmaid.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel sighs]

I'm going to try and get Chauncey arrested.  Because he needs to have consequences for the things he does.

#### TREXEL

Well maybe sometimes people don't need to have consequences because life's unfair and other people need to accept that.

#### HARTRO

So, do you remember why you're here? What, what's the whole purpose of this game? What are you meant to be doing?

#### TREXEL

Beating Lambert at selling wares on Orb 9.

#### HARTRO

You're working together. He's your *helper*. He's, he-- he makes your wares nicer. He fixes them up. He shines them.

#### DAVID

##### [irritated]

Well, I try, but Chauncey just refuses, refuses to help at all!

#### TREXEL

Alright. Alright. How 'bout, how 'bout this? I try and sell my wares by rushing over to Lambert and shouting, "Lambert, Lambert, what a terrible accident. I must help you up and lead you to the bar." And, and I, and I lead--

#### HARTRO

Ooh, ooh, ooh. That might impress--

#### TREXEL

--and I lead to the bar [__HARTRO:__ Yes.] in order to impress upon the young maiden that I am a helpful, wonderful man who might also have socks to sell.

#### HARTRO

Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

What do I-- Do I have to roll for that or...

#### HARTRO

I would call that compliance.

#### TREXEL

Comp-- I have 1 in compliance.

#### HARTRO

##### [stammers]

It's like the, it's like the rules of the universe [__TREXEL:__ Okay, I j--] and  you know, karma and--

#### TREXEL

But I want it, I want it noted that I am trying. I've got 1 die here to try it with but I am trying.

#### DAVID

Yeah, well--

#### HARTRO

Odds aren't good.

#### DAVID

Good luck.

#### TREXEL

##### [grabs die]

Right, okay. I'm trying to help Lambert up.

#### DAVID

Oh, good. After knocking him down.

#### HARTRO

"So you need a 5 or a 6."

#### TREXEL

##### [rolls die]

Yes. Okay.

#### HARTRO

Oooooh.

#### DAVID

Aw, what a shame.

#### TREXEL

That's, that's a 3.

#### HARTRO

That's no good.

#### TREXEL

That's a 3 so I, well, I--

#### DAVID

Chauncey fails like everything in his life.

#### HARTRO

"Chauncey gets arrested."

##### [David laughs, sirens blare]

#### TREXEL

##### [yelling]

##### [David continues laughing]

But I was just trying to help!  David, I am trying-- I'm-- David, I am trying here.

#### HARTRO

"The Orb 9--"

#### DAVID

You hit me over the back of the head with a chair!

#### TREXEL

I overreacted.

#### HARTRO

##### [handcuffs click]

"The Orb 9 police come in and they take  Chauncey away, and all that's left is Lambert the 7th [__DAVID:__ Ooh!] with the wares."

#### DAVID

"Excuse me, barmaid. Could I interest you in a picture of intergalactic heartthrob and dilettante, Bathin."

#### HARTRO

Ooooooh!

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Right, so --

#### DAVID

"It's signed!"

#### HARTRO

Let's use--

#### TREXEL

Lambert has to roll 1 for entrepreneurship. Or 2, was it?

#### DAVID

I have 2 in entrepreneurship.

#### TREXEL

2. Roll, roll 2 for entrepreneurship.

##### [rolls dice]

#### DAVID

That's a 5 and a 2.

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel sighs]

Ooooooooh!  Gorgeous Gaia, the barmaid, loooooves Bathin.

#### DAVID

Doesn't everyone?

#### HARTRO

She buys all of your photos.

#### DAVID

All six? Oh, isn't that successful.

##### [cash register ding]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Warning: all profits, imaginary or otherwise, must be handed over to the Board.

#### DAVID

"Why, thank you kindly, Gorgeous Gaia. Enjoy your six photos of Bathin. You should probably put them up all around your bed so, when you wake up in the morning, you are surrounded by Bathin's nipples."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Nice!

##### [background noises switch to outdoor/bird sounds]

#### HARTRO

"Back out on the road, poor Chauncey is lying in the gutter.

#### TREXEL

I've been beaten by the local law enforcement because they have *no* sense of justice. I have been trampled upon by not one but two cart horses whilst lying in the gutter. I have three broken ribs. And I am feeling sorrowful.

#### HARTRO

"But up they get, and the little travelers move on down the cobblestone--"

#### TREXEL

I'm covered in mud.

#### HARTRO

Yes, it's, it's been a bad day.

#### TREXEL

And my ribs are broken.

#### HARTRO

...Boo hoo. You should've rolled better.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

I use my calisthenics to try and bind my ribs.

#### HARTRO

##### [background sounds turn to baths and dripping water]

"On to the royal baths.  Do do dooo! And they travel down to the great Orbertos Royal Baths. Now, here are a selection of different pools. Each pool, you'll see, is a different color and has a different temperature and a different sort of rumbling bubble mixture. You need to choose which bath is the correct bath that holds the royal Orberto."

#### TREXEL

"So what you're telling me is we've come here to find a bath to 'bath in'."

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Word crimes detected. Security alerted.

#### HARTRO

Y-yes. Yes. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Great.

#### HARTRO

"But don't choose the wrong bath or it might be the end of you."

#### TREXEL

Well, how do I evaluate what's the right bath?

#### HARTRO

"You can ask. Ooh, ask Ortrah questions. Ooooooo."

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

##### [soft, hollow pops as arms and legs retract]

I just, I'll just ask Ortrah questions and then maybe Ortrah will, will help me, and maybe I'll make a right choice for once in my life. May-- maybe, maybe Trexel will make a choice and things will go well. Or maybe, maybe, you know what? Maybe Trexel will just not make a choice. Maybe that's, maybe that's the choice--  I mean, maybe Chauncey will, will not make a choice. Maybe that will be the right thing to do. I'll just stay here inert like a tor-toise in the middle of a crossroads doing nothing because, if I do nothing, nothing can go wrong. I retract my arms and legs  into my shell and I stop moving.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

##### [David sighs]

Unauthorised tortoise detected.  Security hare alerted.

#### DAVID

Fine. Fine. No, yeah. Fine. Lambert also comes in and finds Chauncey retracted into his cape and--

#### HARTRO

"Oh, oh, use your-- use your Lambert voice."

#### TREXEL

"Leave me alone, Lambert. Leave me alone. I'm a hibernating tor-toise."

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

##### [sighs]

"Oh, Chauncey. Well,  although you mess up an awful lot, you... probably mean well despite not... ever acting like it. But, yes, okay. Why don't we work out which pool to go into together."

#### TREXEL

##### [upset]

"But I'm gonna ruin it. I'm gonna ruin it, Lambert. I always ruin it."

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

"Don't worry, Chauncey. Yes, you mess things up but I kind of get the sense that you... sometimes try. [__TREXEL:__ I do.] And you did save my life that one time in the oubliette of Orb 7.5 so, fine. Let's get you up and we'll work out how to do it together."

#### TREXEL

##### [soft, hollow pops as arms and legs extend]

Chauncey's arms and legs gently extend  from his shell and he gets up.

#### DAVID

"Right. Well, luck for you, I read the manual of this bath and it included a map on the back so let's just use--"

#### HARTRO

"Wh-- What? Where'd you get that?"

#### DAVID

"Uh, I took it from the plinth at the front which said, 'Welcome to the baths. Please take a complementary manual.'"

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Unauthorised MacGuffin detected. Security alerted.

#### HARTRO

Hmm...

#### DAVID

I-I roll compliance?

#### HARTRO

Mm, yeah. Let's test-- I don't-- I didn't say you could do that.

#### TREXEL

Sorry, I believe, I be--

#### HARTRO

I jus-- That feels a bit like you've just made some rules up in the game on your own though.

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro stammers]

Well, I think that Lambert using his compliance skill has found a, a helpful map guide to the baths so let's let him roll.  Let's let him roll!

#### HARTRO

What-- Excuse me?! This is my game! I--

#### TREXEL

Yes, but we're following, we're following your rules, Ortarogog.

#### HARTRO

But I didn't-- Ortrah!

#### TREXEL

Ortrah!

#### HARTRO

##### [throws dice at Trexel, they clatter to the floor]

Oooooh!  "I will throw the dice when I need to make a point." Right, I'll let you have this one. Okay. You can roll dice on this one but after that don't invent little... maps unless I've put them there.

#### TREXEL

I believe in you, Lambert. I believe in you.

#### DAVID

##### [rolls dice]

Okay, well, thank you Ortrah. Um...  There's a 6, a 4, and a 2 so that's a, a good, right?

#### TREXEL

That is a success.

#### DAVID

##### [quietly]

That's a success, yes.

#### HARTRO

That, that-- okay fine. Fine. You get a-- "you get a map. Part of the map has been ripped though because."

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Um,  which part of the--?

#### HARTRO

"With all the pictures of the pools on it. So you have the descriptions of the pools but you don't know which ones they go to."

#### DAVID

Okay, so what are the descriptions of the pools?

#### HARTRO

"Oh, okay. There's ten pools--"

#### TREXEL

Ten?!

#### HARTRO

"--eight of which will burn you instantly alive."

#### DAVID

Wait, what kind of bath is this?

#### HARTRO

"It's a... it's a terrible bath for those that try [__TREXEL:__ Yes, it is a--] to get past that should not come past."

#### TREXEL

I like this, yes. It's a terrible bath. A terrible, terrible bath to 'bath in'.

#### HARTRO

Okay, I get what you're doing.

#### TREXEL

It's awful. People don't like it. People don't come.

#### HARTRO

We know you don't like Bathin.

#### TREXEL

It's a failing bath.

#### HARTRO

"Two of the baths, however, are delectable and if you get to those then you can sell all your wares to the royal family."

#### DAVID

Okay. And are there any, any indications of which of the two baths would, would be? Or do we just--?

#### HARTRO

"Well, if you had the whole map, of course."

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

Oh, um. Well,  I go and get another map?

#### TREXEL

Can we do that?

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

Can we just keep on doing things again until they work?

#### DAVID

Oh, I don't know.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You could but it would spoil the fun.

#### HARTRO

Just go up to a bath and... look at it. And I'll tell you what it looks like and then you decide what you want to do. Okay?

#### DAVID

O-okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

Here's an idea. How about... Chauncey finds an orderly and tries to barter with them with a pile of freshly imagined socks.

#### DAVID

Okay, right. Fine. Fine! Yes, okay. Well...

#### TREXEL

Yes, so, so Lambert needs to think, think of some-- think of some socks, Lambert.

##### [David grunts, socks start appearing]

#### TREXEL

##### [socks stop]

Oh, so-- "so many socks. So many socks."  And now I, now I walk over to, to the orderly and say, "What ho, good sir."

#### HARTRO

##### [orderly voice]

"Hello."

#### TREXEL

"I see your feet are uncovered and chilly on this stone floor, are they not?"

#### HARTRO

##### [orderly voice]

"Uh, I don't normally wear anything on my feet."

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

##### [thwap]

"Well, perhaps  today is the day you should change your life, young man." And I, and I present to him a kindly, well-woven pair of socks, like that,  that a parental unit would sew for a child on maybe, let's say, their twelfth birthday.

#### HARTRO

##### [thwap]

Okay, how, how do you present them? "How would you present them, Chauncey?"  This-- we'll use calisthenics.

#### TREXEL

What? No, no! Uh, no, this is entrepreneurship. This is entrepreneurship, surely!

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel sighs]

No, no, no. Do you flip in the air?  Do you, do you sneak around him and, and present them from behind?

#### TREXEL

##### [thwap]

Okay, okay. I've got it. I've got it. Uh, a-- Chauncey is going to hide behind a nearby plant pot and* leap* out holding the socks shouting, "socks for you!"  And that's how-- and that's how he's going to do it.

#### HARTRO

"Okay, well, we will roll, and we'll see how it goes."

#### TREXEL

##### [rolls dice]

Right.

#### HARTRO

Oooooh!

#### TREXEL

That's a, that's a-- well, that's a 1 and a 2. What does this--

#### HARTRO

"Ortrah is very unhappy!"

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

It-- What? Is, is that bad?

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

What does this mean? What happens?

#### HARTRO

"1 and a 2 is a critical failure!"

#### TREXEL

Well, what does that mean?

#### HARTRO

##### [orderly voice]

##### [fishing line reel noise]

##### [thwap]

##### [splash, hissing]

"The man gets so scared when you *fly out* from behind the pot that he takes his--"  "well, I take my fishing line  and I snag both  Chauncey and Lambert the 7th, and I flip them into the pool that eats them up."

#### TREXEL

Wha-- so, okay, couple of--

#### DAVID

Wait, we-- Did we just die?!

#### TREXEL

Couple of things, Hartro--

#### HARTRO

Yes!

#### TREXEL

--couple of th-- Ortrah. Couple of things, Ortrah. So, you're telling me not only does my critical failure kill Lambert, [__DAVID:__ Yeah!] but we are killed with a fishing pole with dual hooks that this *pool attendant* happens to have.

#### HARTRO

##### [orderly voice]

"I am not a pool attendant. I am... the guard of the royal family."

#### TREXEL

Well that wasn't made clear! I thought I found a pool attendant!

#### HARTRO

"You didn't ask! Ortrah knows all. She would have told you if you asked."

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Well, well, uh, well,  fine. No, I suppose we're dead and the game's over.

#### TREXEL

We were-- yeah. We're dead and the game's over.

#### DAVID

So, Ortrah no longer; Hartro now.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Enhanced roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [enhanced electronic powering off sound]

#### HARTRO

Oh. I--

#### TREXEL

Now Hartro only. Ortrah gone.

#### DAVID

'Cause Lambert and Chauncey--

#### TREXEL

Dead.

#### DAVID

--dead now.

#### HARTRO

Well, I can't help it if you kill yourselves on level 3. I had 8 other challenges for you!

#### DAVID

You... you killed us! I didn't--

#### TREXEL

You, you--

#### HARTRO

##### [stammers]

I didn't kill you! You threw the dice! I--  I spent a lot of time on this! I, I organised this whole game. I wore outfits and... you ruin everything!

#### DAVID

Well, I--

#### HARTRO

You ruin everything!

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Well, I-- Fine!

#### HARTRO

Give me that! Give me the clothes--

##### [clothes fall]

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Fine. Just take the clothes.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Fine. Why-- take off my jerkin.

#### HARTRO

You spoil everything.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Well--

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

Sorry, Hartro, but you--  it was quite obliquely ruled and, and, and it feels like you were kind of quite punitive in the way that you... you managed it. And... Did you want us to fail?

#### DAVID

Do you think maybe you over thought it a bit?

#### TREXEL

Maybe you over thought it a little bit.

#### HARTRO

Excuse me. No. No, I thought about it precisely the right amount of... thinking. I've, I created an opportunity for you to become better salespeople and you just ruined it.

#### TREXEL

Well... well now we've failed, Hartro. What, what happens?

#### HARTRO

##### [menacing]

I think you know what happens--

#### TREXEL

##### [afraid]

No.

#### HARTRO

--Chauncey.

#### TREXEL

Oh, Hartro, please. No! Hartro. My jaw's just recovered.

#### HARTRO

No thinking of socks will help you now.

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel muffled mouth full of foot noises]

Oh, go--

#### DAVID

I, I am deeply uncomfortable right now.

#### HARTRO

Well, you can have one too, David.

#### DAVID

No, what?! No!

#### HARTRO

There you go!

##### [David muffled mouth full of foot noises]

#### HARTRO

##### [both Trexel and David make muffled protests]

You should have played my game better.  And there we go.

##### [both spit out feet] [David cries out]

#### TREXEL

The rare double footing.

##### [David cries out some more]

#### HARTRO

I do what must be done.

#### DAVID

I think that was the worst thing that's ever happened to me.

#### TREXEL

Really?!

#### DAVID

I think so. Genuinely, yeah.

#### TREXEL

How?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

That literally cannot be the case.

#### HARTRO

##### [packs up game]

I'm taking my game and I'm going now.

#### TREXEL

It's lovely to see you, Hartro. I, I suppose we'll see you in a, in a bit.

#### HARTRO

And this is for you. Thanks for playing. Signed picture of Bathin just so you remember your foolish, foolish attempts.

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

Thank you.

#### DAVID

Um, can I keep the lil' figurines? 'Cause--

#### HARTRO

No!

#### DAVID

Well, they're quite nice.

#### TREXEL

David, you can have the picture of Bathin.

#### DAVID

Ooh! Thank you very much! I'm gonna put that in the drawer!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

Well, that was... eventful.

#### DAVID

Um... I'm not... not quite sure what, what just happened.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

No one will ever be sure.

#### TREXEL

I think, David, it's... it's best not to question this one too much. Do you know why?

#### DAVID

'Cause we'll get a foot in the mouth?

#### TREXEL

We'll get a foot in the mouth. Did you like the foot in the mouth?

#### DAVID

I, I made it very clear I didn't.

#### TREXEL

Well, in which case, just let's, let's just push on through 'cause I... I get the feeling this might be kind of all Hartro's got right now so I, I think it's gonna be a-- full on.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

And, uh,  well, I'm sorry.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [defensive]

What?!? Y-YOU SHUT UP! Goodbye!
