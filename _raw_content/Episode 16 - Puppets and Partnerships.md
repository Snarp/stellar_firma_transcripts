# __EPISODE 16 - PUPPETS AND PARTNERSHIPS__

# Transcribed 11/28/19 via stellarscripts on tumblr

#### ALEX

Hi everyone, Alex here. Just taking a moment to give you an update on our Patreon. We've been reading out patron names at the start of all of our shows for a while now, as a way of saying thanks to our contributors. However, thanks to having such an amazingly generous fan base, our Patreon has actually been growing a lot faster than we had ever hoped, and we've ended up falling a bit behind in our shoutouts. As a result, starting from now, we're going to be increasing the number of names we read at the start of episodes to reduce the waiting time, and reviewing our records to make sure we haven't missed anyone. This does mean that the thanks segment before every episode will run slightly longer than it has previously, but it's the only way we can make sure we give proper credit to the people who make our content possible. So with that, I just personally wanted to say thanks to everyone for your patience and understanding, and we hope you enjoy today's episode. Eric Zagar, El Addams, John C. Worsley, Lauren, Katie Nolan, Jonathan Clark, Danielle Goldstein, Patrick Perry, Hilary Merline, Anton and Ken, Brooklyn Orchard, Benjamin 'Nothing but BS' Sussman, Slugfarm, Lottie Lynn, Valda Kylie, Emily Kellogg, Sarah Vakos, Monika Cieślińska  and Bojan Panic. Thank you all. We really appreciate your support. If you'd like to join them, go to www.patreon.com/rustyquill and take a look at our rewards.

<p style="text-align:left;">

#### DAVID [nervous]

<p style="font-size:20pt;text-align:left;">O-- oh... where's the brief?! Wh-- where's Trexel, but that's kind of normal, but it-- it's Monday and there's no *brief!* The light's not on, the tube isn't full, I-- I don't--

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Hot diggin' hog, it's Trexel time! Hello, David, how are you?

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

<p style="text-align:left;">Trexel-- Trexel --

#### IMOGEN

<p style="text-align:left;"> Access granted.

##### [bwoop of lights turning on]

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Trexel-- Umm,B-- bad! There's no brief! It's Monday and there's no brief!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">But it's Monday!

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">There's no brief, and it's Monday!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Surely there's a brief!

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">No, look, the tube is empty, the light is off!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Hang on a minute! Lemme take off my glasses.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Okay.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">And my other pair. [__DAVID:__ Ah!] And also this pair.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">O-- okay, it's--

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Hang on. I need to put that last pair back on.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Right--

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">There's no brief!

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Exactly! And I don't know what's going on!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">I'm *furious!*

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Yes! Exactly, there's no brief!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">No, because I didn't need to turn up! If there's no brief, there's no work, if there's no work, why am I here?!

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Oh- Well, given that I'm not currently in a blender, we could use this time to--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

<p style="text-align:left;">Line Manager arriving!

#### HARTRO

##### [David and Trexel scream in alarm]

<p style="text-align:left;">Hello! Oh, you look surprised!

#### TREXEL [distraught, screaming]

<p style="text-align:left;">*Monday?!*

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Hi!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">*It's Monday and you're here!*

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Yes!

#### TREXEL [frantic, screaming]

<p style="text-align:left;">*Why!?*

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Calm down!

<p style="text-align:left;">__TREXEL____: [quieting down]__ Sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">That's not the way you welcome your line manager, Trexel!

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">No, hello Hartro. Hello.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Now let's try that again. [__TREXEL:__ Right.] Hello, boys.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

<p style="text-align:left;">Hello Hartro.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

<p style="text-align:left;">Good hello.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Hmm. Yes, I've had an idea! That's why I'm here! [__TREXEL:__ Please.] Last Friday when I left, I just thought, "Oh, Hartro, they need some team-building exercises!" I don't know why I didn't think of that sooner! [__DAVID:__ Uhh-] And now I'm here, because back in my line manager school... ah, they taught us so many different little devices to teach people that just can't work together, and that's what we're gonna do.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;"> Right, right. It does come to mind, Hartro...

#### DAVID [quietly]

<p style="text-align:left;"> It's Monday.

#### TREXEL

##### [stutters]

<p style="text-align:left;">It's Monday. And we do--

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Are you telling me how to do my job?

#### DAVID AND TREXEL [frantically]

<p style="text-align:left;"> No no no!

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">I can't come in on a Monday and educate my design team? What-- what, Hartro can't just decide to turn up and fix things that are broken?

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">No, Hartro, you can-- you can obviously do absolutely whatever you want, and you clearly have...

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

<p style="text-align:left;">Thank you. Thank you.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">But you never have before! We-- we've done this *thousands* of times, Hartro, and you've-- you've never once turned up and tried to "build the team".

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">And that's an *interesting* point, because *I* would say in the past, your planets? Mmm, not so good. Would you agree?

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Well... "good"-- art is subjective.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Yes.Not good, yes. And I think actually in the past, mmmm... couple weeks, I'd say you've been turning in your designs on time... [__TREXEL:__ Yes, yes, I suppose so.] Terrible planets, yes... so what I'm going to do is try to *salvage* this destroyed wreck of a ship.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Oh, this -- this real dumpster fire of a duo we've got going here.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Yeah!

#### TREXEL

##### [aside]

<p style="text-align:left;">Okay, I'm game. Because it means I don't have to do actual work. David, team building isn't actual work. I've heard about it. You just play fun games!

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">No, look serious, because you're going to be graded on this.

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Oh.

#### HARTRO

##### [clothes shuffling]

<p style="text-align:left;">Now, put these suits on...  That's your team building suit.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Oh. Right, that's a... very smart onesie you've got there, Hartro. Let's just pop these on--

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Oh. Oh, my--

##### [latex stretching]

<p style="text-align:left;">

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">They might be slightly uncomfortable, that's all part of the building of the team. [__TREXEL:__ Oh, it hikes, Hartro!] The two of you are uncomfortable *together*.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">It really grabs at the old... comets.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">So rubbery... [__TREXEL:__ Oh!] So squeaky!

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Look how quickly David got into his. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] Great, so, I'm going to get you both warmed up, all right? You're in your suits, you got your mind in the room... working together, working together. Right, so. Trexel?

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Yes?

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;"> You're going to say a word in a minute. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Don't say it now. [__TREXEL:__ No...] and David 7 is going to just say the first word that comes to his mind! [__DAVID:__ Okay.]  And then once you've done that, David 7, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] (don't start now), then Trexel's going to do another word.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Word now? Word now?

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Would you just listen to the instructions? They are very simple.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">I have so many words!

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">You say a word, David 7 reacts, you listen to the one he react-- just say words. Go.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Okay. Knife.

#### DAVID [eeps]

<p style="text-align:left;">Trexel!

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Er... sweaty.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Uh, uh, David.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Knife.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Trexel.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Moon.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Uhh, trough.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Knife.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Trexel?

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Wait, wait, wait, wait. [__DAVID:__ What?] Trexel, stop saying knife.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">But I was just thinking about--

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">No, no, no, you're working together. Team-building. Words that bring you together. Could you just respond in a more 'team' way, please?

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">In a more 'team' way, okay.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">David 7, you start.

#### DAVID [stutters]

<p style="text-align:left;"> Team.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Build.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;"> Uhh- Planets.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Good!

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">David.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Team.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">David.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Teamwork.

#### DAVID [stutters]

<p style="text-align:left;"> Trexel?

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Working effectively as a team.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;"> Latex.

#### HARTRO [crosstalk]

<p style="text-align:left;"> You say 'team' again, I will smack you.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Okay, um, so...

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Imply team without saying team.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Imply team, but not team words. Okay, I can do this! I can do this!

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Last chance. Go.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">I-I.M.O.G.E.N..

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Togetherness.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Uhh, David.

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Fortitude.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">Um, uh, Planets?

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">Stickin' with it.

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">That's more than one word. [__TREXEL:__ Sorry. Sticky...] Okay, stop it. Forget it, stop it, stop it, you're warm. Okay? Fine. Done.

#### DAVID

<p style="text-align:left;">This suit is not very breathable...

#### TREXEL

<p style="text-align:left;">No, it's not...

#### HARTRO

<p style="text-align:left;">Stop complaining, this is a-- we're a team. [__TREXEL:__ I've got about a half pint in me.] Great. Now that we're all warm, I've just got something here...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Puppets deployed!

#### HARTRO

Right, so, little puppets. [__TREXEL:__ Ooh!] What-- this one's, uh, Trexel, this one's for you, David 7.

#### TREXEL[crosstalk, excited]

That's a little me!

#### HARTRO

That's for you, David 7.

#### DAVID

Oh, uh, okay.

#### TREXEL

Did you make these?

#### HARTRO

I did *not*, I had them made. And this is for you. This is your clone.

#### TREXEL

This just says 'clone' on it. Why doesn't it say "David 7"?

#### HARTRO

Cause it's a clone.

#### TREXEL

Good point.

#### DAVID

Mine-- mine says "Trexel".

#### HARTRO

##### [cuts Trexel off]

There's only one Trexel. [__TREXEL:__ You know what--]  Don't read into that, shush. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Right. Now, what I'd like you to do, [__DAVID:__ Yes?] is just have a moment and act out a typical planet design session.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Trexel-

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

I'm the clone, and David's me?

#### HARTRO

Yes. Yes, so this is you responding how Trexel normally would, David 7.

#### DAVID

Uh, yes.

#### HARTRO

And then Trexel, you're David 7, or clone, and you're in the room waiting for Trexel to arrive, which is a typical day.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound, calm music playing in background]

#### TREXEL [as David] "

Ahh! I'm David 7, a clone. And I'm waiting for Trexel, I love Trexel --"

#### DAVID [as Trexel] "

Blerrrgh! I'm so late and drunk! I've been at the cosmic lounge, not at work! Hey, David, have we got the brief? What? You haven't done any work, despite not being able to do any work because I control everything in this office? Well, that's *your* fault somehow! I've just rolled out of booze bed, and want you to do your work!"

#### TREXEL [as David]

...I see. "Well, ...Trexel, I've been sitting here crying, because I'm a big crybag! Oh, I could do things myself, but--"

#### DAVID [as Trexel]

"Shut up, David! I don't care about your well-being, because I'm Trexel Geistman. Now, do you have a brief?"

#### TREXEL [as David]

"Yes, I have a brief for you."

#### DAVID [as Trexel]

"Then get on with it! Shut up, David!"

#### HARTRO

...I'm just gonna pause you there...

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay paused.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### HARTRO

Now, now, boys... this is good! This is good. Now--

#### DAVID [as Trexel]

"Oh, Hartro, I love you. Please, I'm sad about my parents! [__TREXEL:__ You shut up.] I think of you as a mother figure--"

#### TREXEL

##### [shouting]

You shut your damn puppet mouth, Come here, you--!

#### HARTRO

Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

##### [sounds of Trexel strangling David]

#### HARTRO

Stop it right now!

#### TREXEL [screaming]

Breathe no more, you puppet! Gah!

##### [gurgling sounds from David, followed by winded panting]

#### HARTRO

Trexel, it's just a puppet. You-- you need to calm down.

#### DAVID

That was really my neck...

#### HARTRO

##### [gritted teeth]

NowI'd like you to go stand in the corner... [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] and breathe and 10 seconds of breathing. If you don't come back here calm,  *if you don't come back here calm*... I will *make* you calm.

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I just-- puppet-me really got to real-me.

##### [latex-clad footsteps going away]

#### HARTRO

##### [David 'uh's]

Right, now, David 7... I noticed in that- ah, typical design meeting, there wasn't much *designing* going on.

#### DAVID

No.

#### HARTRO

Hmm.

##### [...]

##### [latex-clad footsteps returning]

#### TREXEL [quiet]

I'm back now.

#### HARTRO

Right.You look calm. [__TREXEL:__ Thank you.] But, we're gonna do it again... give him back his puppet, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Okay, I did tear it a little...

#### DAVID

Oh, his nose has come off.

#### HARTRO

Now, you're going to do it again. This time, you're going to do a design meeting the way that you *wish* that it would go, all right? So, David 7, the way you wish Trexel would do a design meeting. And Trexel, the way you wish David 7 would behave in a design meeting.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel clears throat]

O-- okay.

#### HARTRO

Remember, you're being graded.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay initiated.

#### TREXEL

##### [as David]

Ah.  "I'm... David 7 and I have patiently waited for Trexel, I understand he probably has things on."

#### DAVID [as Trexel] "

Good morning, David 7, I am here and it is nine o'clock in the morning. Have you got the brief yet?"

#### TREXEL [as David]

"Yes and not only that, I got up even earlier than that and made a start."

#### DAVID [as Trexel] "

Well that's good, because you live here and can't get out. Now, let's spend eight hours really thinking about how good this planet could be."

#### TREXEL [as David]

"Well, hey, let's not go overboard. How about we do half an hour, and then stop and finish?"

#### DAVID [as Trexel]

"No. I think we should work through lunch to make up for lost time."

#### TREXEL [screaming]

Are you *mad?!* Are you a madman?! Are you gonna kill me with a knife?!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Knife detected! Security alerted.

#### DAVID [as Trexel, forcefully]

"Ok! I think we should work *late* on this one, David!"

#### TREXEL

Hartro, you can't let this stand. It's clearly a delusional fool!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Work through lunch? *Stay late?* This isn't teamwork, this is madness!

#### HARTRO

Don't grab the puppet. Just give me the puppets. [__TREXEL:__ There you go.] Right. Trexel, I think we've all learned something there. I would say, perhaps, putting more time into the actual design might be appropriate! I think David 7 has a very valid point!

#### TREXEL

What many points he's having. Maybe he'll have *more* points soon, I don't know!

#### HARTRO

We're a team! A point that one of us makes is a point that we all make.

#### DAVID AND TREXEL

Yes.

#### HARTRO

Isn't that true?

#### DAVID

Yes, we've all made the point.

#### TREXEL

We've all made a point. Together!

#### DAVID

All- Yes.

#### TREXEL

Not *at* anyone...

#### DAVID

No...we've just all definitely made a point.

#### TREXEL

All making... *a* point!

#### HARTRO

And I'm going to give you this puppet, Trexel, and I would like you to return it to me in a better form. And I'd like *you* to do the sewing.

#### TREXEL

Right. Okay, I'll sew this right up and get it back to you.

#### HARTRO

##### [David whoops in alarm]

So, let's just try something different. I've got these two pieces of A3 paper. These are your islands of safety. Now, stand over there by the door, __[DAVID:__ Okay.] both of you over there. __[DAVID:__ Right, yes__]__ Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.  __[DAVID:__ Up, up up.__]__  Right. So this is all lava now.  The office is lava.

#### TREXEL

Calm down,David, it's a metaphor.

#### HARTRO

Right. You need to get across, both of you, without touching the lava using these two islands.

#### TREXEL

Right.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

But if even-- even-- even a toe goes in the lava you both just explode.

#### DAVID

Aaah!

#### TREXEL

Everyone who's a person needs to get across, okay, right.

#### DAVID [nervous]

Okay, right.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound, calm music playing in background]

#### DAVID

So, I think what we should do, is--

#### TREXEL

##### [shoves David in]

And jump!

#### DAVID [terrified]

Aah! Ooh! I'm burning!

#### HARTRO

Oh, you just-- you just--

#### DAVID [yelling]

##### [pained sounds]

Aaaah! Ooh, My limbs!

#### HARTRO

##### [to David]

Right. Trexel-- right. You're not-- you're not really burning, David 7.

#### TREXEL

It's a metaphor.

#### DAVID [quietly]

Oh.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### HARTRO

What-- what didn't you understand about that? You've just pushed him into the lava.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Yes! I'm the only person on the team.

#### HARTRO

Okay, this just proved my point. This just completely proves my point!

#### TREXEL

But he's a clone, he doesn't count!

#### HARTRO

##### [gagging]

You're such an idiotic-- egotistical-- massive-- mattery-- flesh-sweating -- alcohol-- moisturiser. Stop looking at me. You make me sick.

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro sighs]

Hartro, are you okay? You're getting red, a little bit.

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, this is just a bit more challenging than I thought it would be. Mm... we're gonna cut to the end! Stand together in the middle of the la-- I mean the floor. Just look at each other.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

Right. Try not to screw this up. [__TREXEL:__ Okay.] Both of you look at each other. You are going to water each other's flowers.

#### TREXEL

I *beg* your pardon.

#### DAVID

Umm.

#### HARTRO

You are going to look at the other one, and tell them something they do well. Something you appreciate about the other. In a sense, watering their flowers! __[TREXEL:__ Okay.__]__ Why don't you start, David 7, because it's probably going to be easier for you.

#### DAVID

Um...Trexel, I... Umm...

#### TREXEL

Go on, David.

#### DAVID

Like... your... glasses.

#### TREXEL

Thank you. Which pair?

#### DAVID

Oh, um, number two, particularly.

#### TREXEL

Strong pair. Strong pair. My turn?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### TREXEL

##### [muttered]

##### [clears throat]

##### [long, disapproving pause]

David. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] I like... hm. Uh... um... no, hang on, I'll get there. You, uh-- no, that's not really about *you*, is it? Um... Okay, okay, okay. Now, David... I like many things. *Some* of them... have a relationship with you. Tangentially. Good? We done?  All right, I'll get more specific! I'll get more specific if you want!

#### HARTRO

Okay. Okay.What does David 7 do for you every time you come in and you design planets? You come in, he's there. Maybe he smiles, oh I don't know, maybe he puts the, uh-- do you put the tube in?

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, yes, yes. I do. I do.

#### HARTRO

He puts the tube in. Just say-- okay, I'll give you this one, I'll give you the first one. "David 7, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] I like that you put the tube in at the end of our design sessions."

#### TREXEL

Okay! Okay, I can do this. I can do this. David--

#### HARTRO

Can you look at him when you do it?

#### TREXEL

##### [abruptly]

Oh, sorry, okay. David. Hello. I like... that you do... what you are required to... at the end... Yep.

#### HARTRO

This is-- this is ridiculous.

##### [overlapping argument]

#### TREXEL

I thought I did it!

#### HARTRO

I have a headache.

#### DAVID

##### [Hartro groans in exasperation]

I could go again?

#### TREXEL

Let David go again, let David go again!

#### HARTRO

No, no, no, cause this isn't-- this isn't the Trexel show! This isn't "Why Is Trexel Good", this is *team building*, Trexel! [__TREXEL:__ One more time, please.] There's no team being built here!

#### TREXEL

Just give me one more chance.

#### HARTRO

No, I just-- I thought this was going to go better. I hate to say it, Trexel, but we might need to do a team restructure. [__DAVID:__ Uhh...] I mean, you were handing in the designs on time, and I thought, "Wow! There might be something to salvage here! Ooh, maybe I could get these two boys working together, and they might actually design a *good* planet!" And now I come here and I see you cannot even water one little David 7 flower.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, Hartro, please just-- just give me one more chance. One more chance just to prove that I *can* work as a team with-- with David.

#### HARTRO

Okay, fine. Fine. You say one nice thing about David 7 right now. Go.

#### TREXEL

Trexel, you've got a great face...Dahh, so close! So close!

#### HARTRO

Right, I will see you at the review, and...  we'll see-- we'll see how it goes. But I'm none too happy.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Line manager departing.

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID

Um... "restructuring"?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

What does, what does that mean?

#### TREXEL

Oh you know, just shuffling things around.

#### DAVID

No, but-- but what does that actually mean?

#### TREXEL

You know, just making changes to the team.

#### DAVID

No, but what does that mean to* you?*

#### TREXEL

Oh, to me? Not a huge amount.

#### DAVID

Okay, but what does that mean to me?

#### TREXEL

Well, you'll find out.

#### DAVID

Well no, but I-- I think I might know what it is, and would like some information about what exactly a restructure might mean. To *me.*

#### TREXEL [rapidly]

It just means realignment of the skill resources of a team that contains me and you! And nothing's happening to me.

#### DAVID

Okay, so... *I'm* being realigned?

#### TREXEL

Sure!

#### DAVID

And that is...

#### TREXEL

A refocusing of the resources that make you* you*.

#### DAVID

Okay, and are we talking about sort of genetic realignment, or-- or--

#### TREXEL

Everything comes down to genetics in the end, David, don't be a-- don't be a-- don't be a-- a poltroon.

#### DAVID [defeated]

Okay. Um, could you say one nice thing ab-- could you water my flowers? I'm having-- I'm feeling quite--

#### TREXEL

But Hartro's *gone.*

#### DAVID

Yeah, but, I'm feeling kind of low, so... might be-- just, you know, Trexel, you could just water-- water my flowers?

#### TREXEL

All right, David, all right, I'll try one last time for *you*. Because you're here. David... you make me feel good about myself. [__DAVID:__ Oh.] Because at least I'm not you.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

But hey, you haven't got long to dwell on that!  [__DAVID:__ Umm.] Because we've got a review in a few days! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] So we've got three planets. Three planets, David, and then I don't know what will happen. I'm not sure. Let's just make 'em count. I mean obviously it's not gonna work, but let's just have fun with it, David!

#### DAVID [quiet]

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And then, you know, stuff will happen to both of us. More to you. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Less to me. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You might die, is what I'm saying.

#### DAVID

Yeah, no, I--

#### TREXEL

Are you understanding it? I mean-- [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Sort of-- I'm trying to be sensitive about this, so... [__DAVID:__ No, I--] They're probably going to recycle you at the end of the next review.

#### DAVID [overlapping]

No, I did guess.

#### TREXEL

But we still got to do three more planets.

#### DAVID

Yes, I know--

#### TREXEL

And we should-- and it probably won't matter.

#### DAVID [sighs]

Trexel, haven't you got a party to go to?

#### TREXEL

No... no.

#### DAVID

Well, haven't you got a seat to sit alone in at the cosmic lounge?

#### TREXEL

I suppose I do! I suppose I do... I don't know why, David, but I feel really down. Maybe I ate a weird olive. Hm. Let's not analyse it too much, we might learn things about ourselves! Bye bye!

##### [door swooshes closed]

#### DAVID [flatly]

Bye.Right. Time to get serious.
