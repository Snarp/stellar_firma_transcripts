# __EPISODE 26 - RETURNS AND REASSIGNMENTS__

## Transcribed 12/6/19 via stellarscripts on tumblr

#### MIKE

Hello everyone, Mike here, the Rusty Quill's video guy, to let you know that Gaming & Giving is back this year and better than ever. Tune in on the 7th of December between 10 am and 10 pm GMT to join us as we roll, button, bash, and bluster our way through 12 hours of board games and video games to raise as much money as we can for Mind, the mental health charity. We'll have many of your favorite RQ crew coming down to play, along with special guests like Bec Hill, Imogen Harris, and Grant Howitt. And once again, you can join us online. We'll be performing this in the Theatre Deli's old library space but, unfortunately, all of our tickets are now sold out. So instead, join us on www.twitch.tv/rusty_quill to take part from the comfort of your own home. That's Gaming & Giving, Saturday the 7th of December on twitch.tv/rusty_quill. See ya there.

##### [David muttering in his sleep]

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David.

#### DAVID

Huh?

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David, I've come to save you.

#### DAVID

Uh-huh.

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David.

#### DAVID

Yeah-huh.

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David.

#### DAVID

Bathin? Bathin, you--

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

I've come to save you, David.

#### DAVID

--with your shirt off.

##### [vent unseals]

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David. David!

##### [David yelps]

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

David, it's me, Trexel. I'm up in the vent. I've come to shave you. Let me out of the vent.

#### DAVID

Why? Why? Why shave me?

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

I lost a bet involving the need of a lot of hair.

#### DAVID

What-- I'm-- uhh. But that's all-- Right. Okay. Fine.

##### [Trexel grunting while getting out of the vent]

#### DAVID

##### [David continues making distressed noises]

Wait. Uh-- Oh!

#### TREXEL

##### [normal]

Right, I've got a razor here. Now, hold still.

##### [razor buzzing]

#### DAVID

Ohh...

#### TREXEL

##### [turns off razor and hits it]

Ow. David, your hair is so oily and greasy. It's-it's gumming up the works of the--  Forget it. Forget it. You've ruined my good razor, David. Happy now?

#### DAVID

Oh, I'm so sorry, Trexel.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Warning--all clone shavings are the property of the Board.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um... you're here.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

And, um... I'm here.

#### TREXEL

Well, traditionally, that's where you are. Here.

#### DAVID

Okay. And this is, um... Trexel. Yep. And this is about usually when you appear.

#### TREXEL

David, is something wrong? You seem to be... confused. We've done this a lot of times and all of a sudden it's, "oh, is this happening? Who am I? What's the time? Why is Trexel here?"

#### DAVID

We-- we had-- well, the trial! And then, and then I... didn't get recycled but it, it felt like some sort of--

#### TREXEL

You're welcome, by the way.

#### DAVID

Yeah-- it just, it felt like--

#### TREXEL

You are-- No sorry, can you just take a moment?

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You're welcome, David.

#### DAVID

But, yeah, okay, no. Just, it felt like the end of... of sort of a... a series of events that, that kind of was like a block of stuff and... and now it kind of felt like something different would be--

#### TREXEL

Why on earth would that be the case?

#### DAVID

I--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Metaphysics detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Well, I just--

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

They said you're fine. You go back to your job.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

What, they're not gonna give you a prize. You barely count as a person.

#### DAVID

So, we're just-- So, we're just doing-- So, we're just-- this is--

#### TREXEL

Crack on with the briefs.

#### DAVID

O-Ok-- Right. So, I'm just gonna... get this.

#### TREXEL

Oh, there was one thing, David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

There was one little thing. Now, I'm aware that sometimes I skip over the detail. I'm not a details-orientated kind of thing. So, just want to make sure we just... back up one second about-- the before the trial.

#### DAVID

The before the trial?

#### TREXEL

Well, I-- you know.

#### DAVID

The working and not happening.

#### TREXEL

Over-- No, no, when I-- When I overreacted a little and stole the brief and--

#### DAVID

And you reset the room.

#### TREXEL

Reset the room.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

It didn't pass my notice that before that you had, shall we say, more access than is traditionally viable for a clone.

#### DAVID [quickly]

No I didn't.

#### TREXEL

David, I-- I really do think you did.

#### DAVID

Hmm, no.

#### TREXEL

No, David, look at me.

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

Look at me.

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

You absolutely did which is why you could alter the briefs.

#### DAVID

Uh-uh-uh.

#### TREXEL

I'm not an idiot, David.

#### DAVID

Eh.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Debatable.

#### TREXEL

I'm-I'm not.

#### DAVID

Mm.

#### TREXEL

And I understand. Now, I just wanted to let you know.

#### DAVID

Hmm.

#### TREXEL

It's okay. I don't mind. That something weird's going on with you and having access to IMOGEN [__DAVID:__ So...] in a more substantial way than you, in any way, should have.

#### DAVID

So, I can... keep recording--

#### TREXEL

No!

#### DAVID

--David's Fact--

#### TREXEL

Absolutely not!

#### DAVID

--Corner?

#### TREXEL

No circumstances can you do that. Because, David--

#### DAVID

__♪__ --Fact Corner! ♫

#### TREXEL

No, David, stop it!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

If people find out [__DAVID:__ Hmm.] that you have some *weird thing* going on with IMOGEN. I don't want to pry.

#### DAVID

I don't.

#### TREXEL

Don't mind what your [__DAVID:__ I don't.] relationship is with IMOGEN. [__DAVID:__ I don't.] I'm not a prude.

#### DAVID

I-IMO-who? GEN-a-what?

#### TREXEL

If they find that out, David, all of my good work in that trial [__DAVID:__ Right.] will be ruined.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I haven't got any more passes to give. After the Cosmic Lounge, there's nothing more than the Astral Bar. After that it's the Staff Canteen and I'M NOT GOING BACK THERE!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Also, you are banned.

#### TREXEL

So, you need to keep this under wraps. Don't touch IMOGEN weirdly. Don't access things you shouldn't have, because if anyone gets so much of a whiff of your weird permissions, we are both in for it and I can't save you next time.

#### DAVID

So, __♪__ David's Fact Corner ♫ is never happening again.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Is David's Fact Cancelled.

#### DAVID

##### [sadly]

Oh.

#### TREXEL

You've got to accept that.

#### DAVID

##### [softly]

Right.

#### TREXEL

Tell me you accept that.

#### DAVID

__♪__ David's Fact Cancelled. ♫

#### TREXEL

Excellent stuff. Now, that doesn't mean, David, you can't do it to yourself and, you know, in a corner while no one notices.

#### DAVID

##### [hopeful]

In a-- in a corner? Full of facts?

#### TREXEL

No-- Ah! No!

#### DAVID

No-- no c--

#### TREXEL

You have to do it against a wall. You're not allowed to do it at the, at the confluence of two walls at a right angle in a room.

#### DAVID

__♪__ David's Flat Corner. ♫

#### TREXEL

If you like. Right, let's crack on with the brief, David. I need to be out and trying the new cocktail they made at the Astral Bar. It's really very nice there!

#### DAVID

Oh, good. Good. Good to hear that you sacrificed so much to save my life and-and-and stop the NUMBER ONE clone-based audio blog about facts in a right-angled area of a room. Good, yes. Brief time, I suppose.

#### TREXEL

Brief time!

#### DAVID

Brief time.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

Right. Hang on a minute. This is, this is new.

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

This is different. There are--

#### TREXEL

Different how?

#### DAVID

Well, different things. There are different thing-- I-I'll read it out. "Who are you?"

#### TREXEL

Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID

Uh, no. Who are they?

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

But it-- it's addressed to them. So, who are you but you is-- They're Professor A. Apidae. They w-- They-they want a planet built because, um, "I need a new laboratory. My old, planet-sized laboratory was destroyed under mysterious circumstances (involving fire)." That bit's in brackets. "And I desperately need a new one. My work on recreating the long-extinct honeybee from earth is important, delicate, and time consuming. And without a place to run my experiments, all my research will be LOST! Years of work will be RUINED! And all my darling honeybee prototypes will PERISH!!!!!"

#### TREXEL

The-- Is it in capitals, David, or--?

#### DAVID

##### [pause to count]

Tho-those were and that one had  five exclamation points.

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, just tone it down. It's very, very late for me.

#### DAVID

Okay. "I--" Hmm. "I need this laboratory to be large with lots of room for my '*honeybees*.'" That was in quotation marks.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

##### [whispers]

Um, and "most importantly of all, in a  *secret* location." That was in caps, but--

#### TREXEL

But, you didn't-- But you-- I understand. Very good.

#### DAVID

"So, I can finally complete my most ambitious scientific project to date! The universe will soon KNOW! MY! NAME!"

#### TREXEL

Well, David, that sounds pretty much like any other brief.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

So far, so normal.

##### [pause]

#### DAVID

"Tell us about your likes and dislikes."

#### TREXEL

What?!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

It-- it asks them about them?!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Caution-- expanded client information detected in design consultation room. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Their likes and their dis-likes. "Likes: scientific research, flowers, hexagons, expensive lab materials, chai lattes, and old sappy earth rom-coms."

#### TREXEL

Very earth centric. This is going to be tricky.

#### DAVID

"Dislikes!--"

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

"Fish, dark colors, circles, mysterious fires, and blatant disregard for the scientific method. If you were an animal, what would you be? Answer: the queen honeybee. What is your greatest strength? My unrelenting passion for *science*!"

#### TREXEL

This is going on for a very long time, David.

#### DAVID

"--and dedication to my work is the only strength I need."

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

"What is your greatest weakness?"

#### TREXEL

More questions.

#### DAVID

"Some people say I'm too fanatical about honeybees. But I don't understand how that's a weakness."

#### TREXEL

'Cause you're a honeybee weirdo, I don't--

#### DAVID

Yes. Uh, Professor A. Apidae is, is probably, definitely a honeybee weirdo.

#### TREXEL

This is so much more information on there than we usually need.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

We normally do it perfectly fine with the small amounts of information we're given.

#### DAVID

Uh-uh.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sass without words is still sass. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

I don't understand, David. That's not the regular form. Now, I will admit, I've never been in a scenario where after a trial the person *in* the trial is still alive.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

But maybe this is some sort of special reward.

#### DAVID

T-trial brief.

#### TREXEL

A trial brief.

#### DAVID

A trial brief?

#### TREXEL

But that doesn't sound like a thing.

#### DAVID

No. Anyway, it's here and last time we didn't submit a brief I... almost got recycled, so.

#### TREXEL

Let's crack on with the brief.

#### DAVID

Yes. Right.

#### TREXEL

Right. Okay, so, so we-- so really, at the heart of it, David, we're building a lab. Now--

#### DAVID

Yes. A big lab. For bees. Honeybees.

#### TREXEL

--I'm not a scientist.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

I am very smart, David, [__DAVID:__ Eh.] and I'm pretty sure I could just do some science, you know, from base principles if necessary.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But what-- what does a lab need? I'm going to say Bunsen burners.

#### DAVID

Uh, right. And honeybees.

#### TREXEL

For-for the Bunsen burners? Do Bunsen burners run on bees?

#### DAVID

Well, a Bun-- no, hang on. But they want to study?-- create honeybees.

#### TREXEL

Well, let me look up-- let me look up the honeybee because I'm not entirely sure what that is. Hang on.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Nice. Let's have a pop on IMOGEN here.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Honeybee fact file.

#### TREXEL

Wow. And they love this thing, correct?

#### DAVID

No, they seem pretty, pretty into them.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, as far as I can see, the honeybee is a weird, pointy insect and, when it defends itself, it snaps in half. Which sounds like a poor design, if you ask me. [__DAVID:__ Well--] If I'd have designed that, if I went down to the Build Team and said, "look, I want an insect. Sure, it needs to defend itself, but when it does, just tear it in half." Now all the guts are falling out.

#### DAVID

Aah! And they'd have said, "yeah, that sounds like Trexel."

#### TREXEL

They would have said-- Did I do this? Did I invent honeybees? IMOGEN, did I invent the honeybee?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Honeybee history and origins.

#### TREXEL

Apparently, someone called Evelyn Lution did. Okay, fair enough.

#### DAVID

Right. So, we need to create a lab for them. Honeybees, that is. Well, no Professor A. Apidae. But, to make honeybees.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

To prototype honeybees? They were prototyping "honeybees."

#### TREXEL

I understand, David.

#### DAVID

Are they trying to improve honeybees?

#### TREXEL

They're trying to improve the honeybee because this-- I thought this was very earth centric. There are certain people who are-- what should we call them? Let's not beat about the bush. Earth perverts. They pine after the lost world of earth because Stellar Firma Ltd. has a very, very strong marketing campaign about our brand, our special stuff. Why are we the only group in the known universe who can build planets as best they can?

#### DAVID

Clones.

#### TREXEL

No, it must be because we are from a planet that was special and lost. [__DAVID:__ Ah.] People love old things that are lost. They think ancient wisdom is a thing; it's not. Everything in the past was always worse, but people don't seem to accept that. So, we say, "Oh, the earth was full of mystery and wonder--"

#### DAVID

And honeybees.

#### TREXEL

"--and honeybees. And they must be great because they're gone now." And for some reason, people *really* dig that sort of thing. So, they are a victim of marketing. A-a poltroon. A shill if you will.

#### DAVID

Wait-- uh, eh-- don't the Board approve the marketing?

#### TREXEL

Oh, and it works perfectly.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Alert. Detecting criticism of Board marketing policy.

##### [gun appearing, building itself, low tone beeping]

#### DAVID

Oh, right, okay.

#### TREXEL

This is good-- So, okay, okay, everybody calm down.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

I am not criticizing the marketing of The Board.

#### DAVID

I love Earth. It's a really good place that I would like to go if it hadn't died.

#### TREXEL

And so well marketed, I feel.

#### DAVID

Yes, very good marketing.

##### [gun disassembles and retracts]

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Subservience to marketing policy--accepted.

#### TREXEL

There we go.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Watch it buster!

#### TREXEL

And, but what I'm saying, David, is this poor, simple Professor A. Apidae has fallen for this and dedicated their entire life to recreating even but one small element of earth, the honeybee.

#### DAVID

Yes. Um--

#### TREXEL

So, they want a lab [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] in which they can recreate the honeybee.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, a bee is a pointy insect that flies around and breaks in half when it defends itself.

#### TREXEL

It's like a knife with a face.

#### DAVID

Okay. Face knife.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Flying face knife.

#### TREXEL

A flying face knife.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Flying face knife detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Uh, but a *bad* flying face knife.

#### TREXEL

It snaps in half.

#### DAVID

One use--

#### TREXEL

You try and cut into a parsnip? It just snaps in half.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right.

#### TREXEL

And also, your parsnip is now *full* of insect poisons.

#### DAVID

Yes, umm, but what is a "honey"?

#### TREXEL

Hmm?

#### DAVID

Well a "honey". That's a bee. What is a "honey"?

#### TREXEL

Uh... What's a "honey"? Now, I could look this up, but I like to think that my scientific mind can work it out.

#### DAVID

From base principles.

#### TREXEL

I think it's... the joint in your leg...

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

...Yep.

#### DAVID

That's-- no, that's it?

#### TREXEL

Yes. Well, 'cause you've got a knee, right?

#### DAVID

So, it's a knee bee?

#### TREXEL

Sure.

#### DAVID

And a honey is your knee?

#### TREXEL

Sure. Huh? Knee. What's that? It's a knee. Huh?!? Ooh, sorry. Excuse me, stop the bus. What's this? Everybody turns around, they're like, "why'd you stop the bus? That's just a knee."

#### DAVID

So, it's a huh-knee-bee.

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

It's a confused, knife flying insect that snaps in half about what a knee is.

#### DAVID

Yep, everything really is the same as it was.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Good. A huh-knee-bee.

#### TREXEL

So, we're-- look. You can research anything in a lab. Just-just-just it's just a lab. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] People say, "oh, it's a lab for this. It's a lab for that." It's all just flames and beakers, David, so [__DAVID:__ Right.] we just need to give them a-- just a basic lab. It's fine.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

The Board reminds you that no science may take place outside designated lab zones.

#### DAVID

Well, okay. Basic lab, sure. But this new brief doesn't have the one non-negotiable feature, right?

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

But it does have these likes and dislikes. So, just in the interest of, maybe, not having a brief that's "just make them a lab, I guess", [__TREXEL:__ Uh-huh.] which I think the Build Team might get angry with. We need one that sort of...  "We need to incorporate scientific research." Probably fine. It is a lab. That is where science happens.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's where science-- that's where the science is kept.

#### DAVID

Uh, they need flowers.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Which, I don't... really get why that's related to knees. Or flying kni--

#### TREXEL

##### [sniffs]

It's because-- Look, when you kneel down [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] in some-- in-in like a wooded glade or-or-or amongst the loam filled mounds of a park. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] What's there? Not just grass, David, but flowers that scent the knee. And then later, people walk around and go, " Do your knees smell of grass?" And you're like, "not only that, also flowers."

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

And then they-- they date your knee.

#### DAVID

So, knee perfume.

#### TREXEL

Knee perfume.

#### DAVID

Okay. Hexagons.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm.

#### DAVID

Um--

#### TREXEL

That's the sexiest shape.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, "expensive lab materials" so it needs to be in--

#### TREXEL

That's the sexiest kind of material.

#### DAVID

"Chai latte"?

#### TREXEL

Okay, okay. Look, we're really getting bedded down in what *they* want. "Oh, look at me! I'm the client. I've been asked my likes and dislikes."

#### DAVID

Yes... exactly what you said.

#### TREXEL

Don't pander to them, David.

#### DAVID

But they want what they want and we're supposed to give-- our literal job is to give them what they want.

#### TREXEL

They don't *know* what they *want*.

#### DAVID

But they've asked for what they want!

#### TREXEL

B-but they didn't know!

#### DAVID

##### [counting from paper]

Professor A. Apidae has specifically asked for [__TREXEL:__ Uh-huh.]  one, two, three, four, five, six. SIX! Six things, six things that they want.

#### TREXEL

And if you remember from earlier, David, Professor A. Apidae is a poltroon!

#### DAVID

Of marketing?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

But we want them to be, because The Board made the marketing. The marketing is good.

#### TREXEL

Alright, fine. We're marketing slaves now. "Oh, Mister Marketing, tell me what to do."

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Chain of command correctly identified.

#### TREXEL

Fine, right. Okay, so, we're going to put all this stuff-- Look, okay, let-- Right. Fine. So, w-we-- A lab needs to be somewhere... sterile, yes?

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So, let's just get a glass ball. Glasses wipe down. I should know; I've got a coffee table at home and *nothing's* stuck to that.

#### DAVID

Right, so a big-- a big, glass ball.

#### TREXEL

Like a giant marble hanging in the sky. You've got to be careful with a giant marble hanging in the sky because, if it refracts the light, it will turn into a laser beam!

#### DAVID

Uh, but, also, you did say your coffee table at home [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] *nothing* sticks to that, including, assumedly, a laboratory.

#### TREXEL

Ah! Coasters.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

On my coffee table at home [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] nothing sticks to it, unless you pop it on a coaster.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

The coaster's made of a-a rubbery material and it grips to that.

#### DAVID

Right. So, we've got--

#### TREXEL

And it makes the whole other rest of the, the table wipe down.

#### DAVID

So, we've got a big, big glass ball of ref--

#### TREXEL

Yes. Slap a massive coaster on there.

#### DAVID

Mm-hmm.

#### TREXEL

Now, as long as the ball is big enough, the curve won't matter too much. It'll wobble a bit, sure, but you can just say, "that's another vector in my experiments."

#### DAVID

Right, so that's--

#### TREXEL

"The wobbling corner of my building."

#### DAVID

More science.

#### TREXEL

Yes, it-it's more science.

#### DAVID

Okay, so wobbling is more scientific?

#### TREXEL

Absolutely.

#### DAVID

Okay. So, we-- w-we're wobbling the thing.

#### TREXEL

Okay, so, we've got a wobbly lab that's on just a very slight curve. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.] And you just pop a lab [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] onto a coaster [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] onto a glass ball [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] and you paint that glass ball some color so that it doesn't turn into a death ray when the sun comes in.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, so, you've got a big sterile-- let's say red. Red's nice. Wait, what color do knees like? Or bees? If I was a fragile flying knife--

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, time for some roleplay.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

Picture the scene.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You are *the worst* insect ever made.

#### DAVID

"Oh, I'm rather rubbish. Evelyn Lution made me, and they're not very good."

#### TREXEL

##### [David starts buzzing]

Now, now, just think about it. You've gone into a department store. [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] You're flying around.  You're considering if you should try and defend yourself in a way that causes your death. [__DAVID:__ Woo!] But not yet. You've seen a rack of sample tiles. [__DAVID:__ Ooh!] All the different colors. Which ones are you drawn to?

#### DAVID

##### [buzzes in increasingly higher pitch]

Oh, I'm in-- I'm uninterested. I'm uninterested, but there are some knees and the knees are wearing knee pads. And these pads are colored...

#### TREXEL

Yes. Yes! Yes! Yes!

#### DAVID

...Violet!

#### TREXEL

Violet!

#### DAVID

Violet.

#### TREXEL

Violet knee pads?

#### DAVID

Violet knee pads.

#### TREXEL

That's a snazzy knee pad.

#### DAVID

Very fetching. Very in this season.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

Fine, well, I'm not going to argue with that, David, because I wasn't the bee in that situation. You were.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

So, we're making this a violet marble.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

That does sound like the word violent. Is that a problem?

#### DAVID

Mm...

#### TREXEL

Has anyone ever been threatened by a violent marble?

#### DAVID

Um, I don't, I don't know. I-I don't, I don't-- I don't know! I don't--

#### TREXEL

Check it.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

What-- um, IMOGEN.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

#### DAVID

Completely normally and with the requisite permissions that a clone called David, who is 7, can access, has anybody ever been threatened by a violent marble?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Playing archival holovid of: *The Six Marble King Rebellions*.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

##### [video of gunfire, yelling, and explosions]

#### TREXEL

__[____crosstalk____]__ Well, that's a lot of-- that's a lot of wars. That's a lot of wars for a marble race.

#### DAVID [

__crosstalk____]__ That is a-- ooh, okay.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

Six marble wars.

#### TREXEL

Six marble wars.

#### DAVID

Ugh.

#### TREXEL

You'd have thought after the first one everyone was like, "chill out. It's just a glass ball."

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Turns out: no.

#### DAVID

Hmm.

#### TREXEL

##### [silence]

Have we built some sort of hate crime?  It wouldn't be the first time, David. It wouldn't be the first time.

#### DAVID

Possibly. Right, so, what's the most calming color?

#### TREXEL

Hmm, okay, well, I'm-- I'm just going to have to think back to, to my past fights.

#### DAVID

Activate roleplay.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### DAVID

You--

#### TREXEL

Woah!

#### DAVID

--are Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

Did you activate the roleplaying?

#### DAVID

N-no. Trexel activates the roleplay

#### TREXEL

I did? Excellent stuff.

#### DAVID

Right. You are Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

Oh, gosh!

#### DAVID

General of the Geistman 50,000.

#### TREXEL

I have 50,000 people! And I'm unimaginative in my naming conventions!

#### DAVID

Yes. And you have been threatened by anyone else!

#### TREXEL

No! I always suspected anyone else was up to something!

#### DAVID

But wait! There is a color in front of you.

#### TREXEL

Hmm.

#### DAVID

A color that means "do not do war."

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

"Maybe have a nice bath... amongst some flowers."

#### TREXEL

Oh, gosh. A bath does sound nice.

#### DAVID

But what color is the bath water?

#### TREXEL

It's a calm, cool shade--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--Of--

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

--Pale blue.

#### DAVID

Pale blue. Pale blue! End roleplay... said Trexel.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### TREXEL

##### [tries to use mind power]

I did? Gosh. You know what, I'm getting so good at the roleplay, it's just sort of happening. Am I--? Do I have mind powers? Hang on a minute.

#### DAVID [whispers]

IMOGEN, activate the roleplay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision telepathically initiated.

##### [electronic powering on sound]

#### TREXEL

##### [tries to use mind power]

Oh! Ooh! Ah! I-- David, this new power, I need to treat it with responsibility. Wait a minute. Quickly, can you look up if Bathin's head exploded?

#### DAVID [whispers]

IMOGEN, did Bathin's head explode?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [pause]

Checking status of: Bathin.Head is intact. And chiseled.

#### TREXEL

Ah, it didn't.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

#### DAVID

Might be limited to... range. You'll have to practice every day.

#### TREXEL

Could be. Could be.

#### DAVID

##### [laughs]

If you just set your mind to it...

#### TREXEL

Might have to have a quick holiday to Galactonium later. I'll get you, you big headed Bath--

#### DAVID

Anyway! Right, so, we've got a nice, calming pale blue ball.

#### TREXEL

Wonderful.

#### DAVID

With a rubber mat--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

--and a laboratory [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] which I'm gonna say is hexagonal.

#### TREXEL

Yeah, well, sure.

#### DAVID

A sexy laboratory.

#### TREXEL

A sexy, sexy laboratory.

#### DAVID

A sexy bee laboratory.

#### TREXEL

It's sometimes hard to do science if it's too sexy in some way. But I think in this particular case, the honeybee, I think it's a sort of a raunchy insect.

#### DAVID

But wait!

#### TREXEL

Hmm?

#### DAVID

What if we color it the least sexy color?

#### TREXEL

Oh!

#### DAVID

The lab, I mean, not the bees. Maybe the bees?

#### TREXEL

Okay, so-so the ball is a calming pale blue.

#### DAVID

##### [relaxed]

So, you're like,  "ahhh!"

#### TREXEL

##### [titillated]

But could also be like,  "*ooh*" but you don't want that [__DAVID:__ Exactly.] because it will get in the way of the science. What's the least hot color? Right, David.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Roleplay time.

#### DAVID

Right. Um--

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision initiated. Again.

__[____electronic powering on sound____]__

#### TREXEL

You are in a basement.

#### DAVID

Ugh!

#### TREXEL

There is mold on the walls.

#### DAVID

Ew.

#### TREXEL

You've been poked in the eye.

#### DAVID

Ahh!

#### TREXEL

Not so hard that it's, like, dangerous but unpleasantly.

##### [David groans]

#### TREXEL

##### [David sniffs the air]

The seat you're on is quite cold. There's this smell in the air.  It's sort of like hot eggs. Hot, old eggs.

#### DAVID

Eh, oh, ugh! I don't like it.

#### TREXEL

You've got a photo album open __[DAVID:__ Hmm?__]__ of just dead animals.

#### DAVID [disappointed]

Oh...

#### TREXEL

Now, that's the least sexy scenario I can think of. What color is the room?

#### DAVID

##### [monotone]

Beige.

#### TREXEL

Oh, sort of a beige.

#### DAVID

##### [monotone]

Beige.

#### TREXEL

Oh, so, not a gross-out color but it's sort of a-- just a--

#### DAVID

##### [monotone]

It's beige.

#### TREXEL

Okay, it's a beige lab.

#### DAVID [monotone]

I'm beige now.

#### TREXEL

Oh, well-- David--

#### DAVID

##### [monotone]

David is beige now.

#### TREXEL

No, David. David, come back to me.

#### DAVID

##### [monotone]

David is beige.

#### TREXEL

No, David, don't-don't be beige. 'Cause you're really boring otherwise.

#### DAVID

##### [monotone]

David is beige.

#### TREXEL

##### [tries to use mind power]

Come back. Okay, hang on, I'm just going to end the roleplay with my mind.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Roleplay holovision terminated.

##### [electronic powering off sound]

##### [David comes out of his trance]

#### DAVID

Ahh! That was awful.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

I was in a horrible room.

#### TREXEL

But you're back with me now.

#### DAVID

With dead dogs.

#### TREXEL

Oh, no!

#### DAVID

Mm. Well, pictures of-- You-- Uh, right. Okay.

#### TREXEL

That's back in the swing of things, though.

#### DAVID

Okay, so--

#### TREXEL

Look at that planet!

#### DAVID

Right, so we have a--

#### TREXEL

We have marble.

#### DAVID

--beige lab.

#### TREXEL

Beige lab.

#### DAVID

Rubber mat.

#### TREXEL

Bees made of knees.

#### DAVID

Bee knees. Honey knees. Huh-knee-bees. Here they are.

##### [alarm blaring]

#### DAVID

Ooh, the alarms going off!

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

Right, okay, submit the brief. Okay.

##### [error buzz]

#### TREXEL

Go, David, submit the brief.

#### DAVID

Uh, uh.

##### [error buzz]

#### TREXEL

##### [nervous chuckle]

David.  David, submit the brief.

#### DAVID

Hold on-- Wah!

##### [error buzz]

#### TREXEL

Do you want to go back to jail, David?!

##### [David makes panicking noises]

##### [error buzz]

#### TREXEL

DAVID, PUT THE BRIEF IN THE TUBE!

##### [error buzz]

#### DAVID

David's not going back to jail! David's not going back to jail!

#### TREXEL

PUT THE BRIEF IN THE TUBE!

#### DAVID

I'm not going back! You can't make me!

#### TREXEL

David!

#### DAVID

##### [yells]

I'm not going!

##### [door swooshes open] [door swooshes closed]

##### [Trexel and David panicking]

#### HARTRO

Trexel! What in Board's name is going on in here?!

#### DAVID

Hartro. Hartro. Hartro. Hartro. Hartro. Hartro. Hartro. Hartro. Hartro--

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Hartro. Harto, something terrible has happened. David, calm down.

##### [Trexel hits David]

#### HARTRO

Both of you, on the floor! Sit down.

##### [David whimpers]

#### HARTRO

What are you doing here?!

#### DAVID

Umm--

#### HARTRO

Why is it such a mess-- Why are you in here?

#### DAVID

Brief. Brief.

#### TREXEL

The brief won't go in the tube, Hartro. Something terrible is happening.

#### HARTRO

Of course it won't go in the tube! You idiot!

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Why can't-- why can't we send the brief?

#### HARTRO

Do you remember what I said to you, you're in Sales now.

#### TREXEL

I'm in a what now?

#### HARTRO

You're in Sales Division now. You've been moved. You've been rearranged.

#### TREXEL

I've been promoted?

#### HARTRO

You've been *shifted*.

#### TREXEL

I've been promoted! I've been promoted back to Sales! This is a-- this is a great day, David! I've been promoted back to Sales where I belong! Ha!

#### HARTRO

Alright, simmer down.

#### TREXEL

Oh, oh gosh. Oh, gosh. Thank The Board. Oh.

#### DAVID

Sales...?

#### TREXEL

Yes, David, Sales. It's a more prestigious department. I-I started in Sales but I was kicked out pretty quickly.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

And I've been moved back. Finally, people have understood my achievements! Yes?

#### HARTRO

No. I mean, wha-what do you want? Do you want me to clap? Do you want me to stand here and go "oh, Trexel, wow, wow, wow." You're just not very good at making planets, okay, so they've moved you.

#### DAVID

Well, Trexel--

#### HARTRO

Maybe it's in one direction or the other but...

#### TREXEL

Don't worry, David. I know in my heart this is a promotion, [__DAVID:__ That's fine.] and I think Hartro's being a little salty about it [__DAVID:__ Well, Trexel.] because, technically speaking, this will be a promotion above her. [__DAVID:__ It's--] Just putting it out there.

#### DAVID

Well, Trexel, it was nice working with you. Um, I had a lot of... as your... bye. Good. Uh, enjoy Sales.

#### HARTRO

Uh, David, you're going with him.

#### TREXEL

You're coming with me, David. We're bonded.

#### DAVID

Ah.

#### HARTRO

Both of you idiots are going to Sales, don't ask me why. I don't understand, but you need to go and you need to be there now.

#### TREXEL

Come on, David, pack up your things.

#### DAVID

Uh, things?

#### TREXEL

Get-- go to your pod and pack up your things.

#### HARTRO

What, you're not-- you're not packed yet?

#### DAVID

Pod?

#### TREXEL

Yes, your pod. Hang on.

##### [pushes button, beep, pod door swishes open, light clicks on]

#### DAVID

That's a bed.

#### TREXEL

Yes, and a desk and your toilet.

#### DAVID

I've... I-I've been going in the chair.

#### HARTRO

Ugh.

#### TREXEL

Well, I suppose you could go in the chair. I suppose it would flush it out but it's not very pleasant. Use the toilet!

#### DAVID

No! [__HARTRO:__ David.] What-- there was no toilet! There was no bed! I've never lain down!

#### TREXEL

##### [David groans angrily louder and louder]

Uh, you know what's happened here? Bit of a whoopsie on my part. Not sure I ever... told David there was a pod with a, with a, with a bed inside in-in-in the room. Which means you've must have just been sitting and lying on the floor. Hey-ho, we live and learn. And on the upside, you don't have to pack!

##### [David's groan continues]

#### HARTRO

##### [sarcastic]

Isn't this great? Isn't this great? This is who's going to be dealing with our Sales for Stellar Firma. Oh, fantastic.

#### TREXEL

Well, we-- We must be--

#### HARTRO

We're used to not selling a damn thing.

#### TREXEL

Well, Hartro, your criticisms aside, we must be incredibly late. And everybody knows Trexel Geistman hates being late!

#### DAVID

What?!

#### TREXEL

How are we going to get all the way over to Sales in time?

#### HARTRO

Trexel, you're *always* late. But you do have a point. I'm going to have to flush you.

#### TREXEL

Oh.

#### DAVID

Flush?

#### HARTRO

And I'm looking forward to it. I hope it hurts.

##### [click, alarm blares]

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Oh, David, we're being flushed. [__DAVID:__ Wait--] Ho-hold your nose, David. HOLD YOUR NOSE!

##### [mechanism being lowered]

##### [Trexel and David yell as they fall]

#### TREXEL

##### [far away]

Avant-Geistman!

##### [flushing noise, mechanism comes back up]

##### [show theme starts]
