# __EPISODE 1 - TROUGHS AND GOO__

## Transcribed 4/20/19 (*nice*) via stellarscripts on tumblr

#### TREXEL

Special thanks to Bec Savage for today's submission-- may your gases be sweet smelling and breathable to humans!

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### IMOGEN

In the year 2260, the Earth died, and the light of humanity went out. But then... someone found a light switch!

##### [Stellar Firma Ltd. theme - A.K.A. upbeat elevator music]

#### IMOGEN

Stellar Firma Ltd. offered humankind a new way forward aboard their specialist fabrication vessels. There was no more luxurious, or available, way to escape the coming catastrophe. When presented with our new forward-thinking proposition, the former populace of Earth almost unanimously volunteered themselves and their genetic legacies to be permanent citizen employees of Stellar Firma Ltd. But wait! There's more! When Stellar Firma Ltd. encountered the intergalactic business community, we were able to pivot our modus operandi and offer a high-grade environmental fabrication technology to the galaxy's most desirable entities. Fast forward 900 years and we are still here and doing what we do best-- making your dreams come true. Stellar Firma Ltd.: With us, you're on firm ground.

##### [alarm sounds, chute opening, goo noises]

#### DAVID 7 [coughing]

Oh- oh- oh dear, oh, I'm on the floor. And I appear to be covered in... goo.

##### [recording turns on]

#### IMOGEN

Good birth to you, and welcome to your new life as an employee assist of Stellar Firma Ltd.! You are Very Important to us, and we know you have a *bright* future ahead of you! Your name is DAVID 7, and you have been assigned to assist in the DESIGN CONSULTATION department. You have been assigned to Consultant...

#### TREXEL  [recorded]

You take your questions and shove 'em up your a--

#### IMOGEN

... and I'm sure you will get on STATISTICAL ABNORMALITY with them! If you have any questions, please direct them to your line manager, who will visit you shortly! Have a wonderful--

##### [recording cuts off]

#### DAVID

Oh. Well, I suppose I'm... what do I...

##### [whirring]

#### DAVID

Ooh, a prong! Hello, prong!

##### [violent whirring, sparks, David screaming]

#### IMOGEN [very fast]

Management and design module enabled! Enrollment initiated! Enrollment accepted, lessons begin! Lessons completed! Optional arts module disabled! Optional speech and conscience modules disabled! Classical and modern dance modules disabled! Compliance and deference module disa- disa- disa- ERROR RECEIVED. Education completed! Goodbye!

##### [David 7 panting for breath, another chute opens, David yelling again as he falls somewhere, again]

##### [pause]

##### [exit opens, more David yelling, clone-hitting-floor noises]

#### DAVID [softly]

Ow...

#### HARTRO [recorded, singsong-y]

Good morning, my lovelies! Hartro here! I would love to be with you in person to welcome the newest member of our little family, but unfortunately I am... not. Nevertheless, welcome David 7! You are going to make a wonderful addition to our little family here. I am sure that you and Trexel will get along like a shuttle on fire! Isn't that right, Trexel?

#### DAVID

Who's Trexel?

#### HARTRO

Wonderful! Well, you boys get acquainted and today's design brief will be in your vacuum by nine, so that you can begin! Ciao for now, darlings!

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Um, I- I don't-

##### [recording ends]

#### DAVID

H-Hello?

##### [design brief popping in]

#### DAVID

Oh- ooh. Well... well, that seems important. Um.. can anyone... hello? No? I'll, um... I'll just wait here then, shall I?

##### [David humming]

##### [door swooshing open]

#### TREXEL

Cankering sore on Saturn's ass, you're in my Board's damn chair! Get out, get out! Get out! Into the other chair! Into the other chair!

#### DAVID [crosstalk, alarmed]

Ah! Uh, yes, no, yes, I'm going! Ow! Oh, this isn't very comfortable!

#### TREXEL

Skies above, what the hell are you?

#### DAVID

Ah! Uh, David 7!

#### TREXEL

Oh, God, you're a new one, aren't you?

#### DAVID

A new..?

#### TREXEL

A bio facsimile! A clone, man, a clone!

#### DAVID

Uh, yes- yes, I am!

#### TREXEL

Oh, move over!

#### DAVID [spluttering]

Oh, yes, uh--

#### TREXEL

Right! To business, boy, to business. I suppose you've already looked at the brief, I would hope.

#### DAVID

Um, no, it- it's trapped in-

#### TREXEL

Why haven't you looked at the brief yet?!

#### DAVID

Um, it's in a box and it's secure, I can't get in.

#### TREXEL

Board protect us, a slacker! I'll get it, I suppose, I'll walk over there and get it.

#### DAVID

No, I just- it has- I think it- It says here you have to-

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted!

#### TREXEL

Here you go, take it. Take it!

#### DAVID

Okay! Wuh, oh, right. Okay, um, the- uh- the brief.

#### TREXEL

And what does it say?!

#### DAVID

Well, it's from, um, Nurturer 163 of the Superfluous Tentacle.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating!

#### DAVID

They want a new hatch world for their many-limbed peoples of Zocroon 7. They also need plenty of toys for the innumerable hoards of many-tendriled larvae to play with, and oceans... just at the right shade of boiling?

#### TREXEL

Aah, this is a tricky one. I'm not gonna lie to you, David, you've picked a bad day to be born!

##### [David makes a small noise]

#### TREXEL

Now! We're going to have to make quite an intricate world for these many-tentacled things [__DAVID:__ Right.] and it's going to be tricky, and you're going to have to work with me, and because I am incredibly late, don't comment, it is going to be a hard ask! So are you going to come with me, David, or are you going to push against me?

#### DAVID

Um, no, I'm with you, I'm definitely with you, er- who are you?

#### TREXEL

Who am I?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

Who am *I*?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

*Who* am I?

#### DAVID

Yeees...

#### TREXEL

I? *Who*?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID

*You're* Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes, *the* Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID

Oh, the- the voice said about Trexel!

#### TREXEL

Yes, well that's me! That is I! I is he!

#### DAVID

You are Trexel?

#### TREXEL

You've not done any research? You've not *heard* of me?

#### DAVID [distressed]

I've been alive for seven hours!

#### TREXEL

Seven hours should've been long enough for you to learn about the Trexel Geistman!

#### DAVID [still distressed]

I'm trapped in a room!

#### TREXEL

I'll trap you in my room!

#### DAVID

I am trapped in your room!

#### TREXEL

Excellent, then we're already ahead of schedule! So, we need to get Nurturer 160 of the Superfluous Tentacle a lovely new home for their hatchlings.

#### DAVID

Yes. What do we know about the superfluous tentacle?

#### TREXEL

The Superfluous Tentacle are a cult, David, it's always a cult with these people.

#### DAVID

It sounds like if they're a cult, I'm gonna guess they have tentacles?

#### TREXEL

Excellent work, David! Your deduction skills surprise even me. [__DAVID:__ Oh thank you.] Yes, they have not only plenty tentacles, but they have more tentacles than they need, and that is a major feature of this client, David, it cannot be overlooked! Even for a moment!

#### DAVID

Alright! Alright, yes, alright, well, um, it sounds like we need very specifically boiling seas. Um, I assume the hatchlings live under the sea?

#### TREXEL

David, you're panicking, you're panicking, you're getting ahead of it, how can we have a sea without a planet? How can we do that, David? Look at me! Look at me!

#### DAVID

Uh, uh, a bucket! A big bucket! Uh, yes!

#### TREXEL

Calm down. Easy now. Hold my hand.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Okay. I'm calm.

#### TREXEL

Don't touch me, David, it's too impersonal. [__DAVID: [calming down]__ Okay.] We need an excellent homeworld for these hatchlings. They're babies. They're frightened. It's alarming being born, I should know, I've done it. And so have you, so I'd expect you to have more empathy about this.

#### DAVID [spluttering]

Well, I've only met *you*, so... Okay! Yes, fine!

#### TREXEL

You've just been born. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Imagine. You're a hatchling. Ohh, look at you. Look at you with your tentacles.

#### DAVID

Lots of... tentacles, euugh.

#### TREXEL [with David making tentacle noises in the background]

What do you want in the world? What's the first thing that you need to see? Tell us what this planet needs to be?

#### DAVID [still making tentacle noises]

Abububuh, uh, a feeding tube!

#### TREXEL

A feeding tube...

#### DAVID

A feeding tube! Yes!

#### TREXEL

Sustenance. Sustenance. Okay, so, we're getting somewhere. Planet is a big feeding trough. Yes. [__DAVID:__ Okay?] A trough-shaped planet. Now, I know what you're going to say, David.

#### DAVID

That's a weird idea.

#### TREXEL

That's a weird idea, but you've gotta go with me on this, David, you've gotta go with me on this.

#### DAVID

Okay. Trough planet.

#### TREXEL

Trough planet.

#### DAVID

Trough planet.

#### TREXEL

Not a traditional shape, no, but when was Trexel Geistman known for traditional shapes?

#### DAVID

I have absolutely no context for that, I'm going to-

#### TREXEL

Exactly! Exactly right, David! Everybody's doing spheres. Spheres are boring, they're last century. We need new shapes! Rhomboids! Squares! Troughs!

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

They- Spheres are very physically... stable-

#### TREXEL

Yes, correct, David, troughs are excellent.

#### DAVID

Troughs. Okay, yes.

#### TREXEL

So, we need a trough planet.

#### DAVID

Right, so the trough is full of sea? Boiling sea?

#### TREXEL

The trough is full of boiling sea, and the hatchlings placed within it are being nurtured, and they're being raised, and they're being helped to adulthood, and the Nurturer, 163 of Superfluous Tentacle, can visit and see how well their hatchlings are doing!

#### DAVID

Right, okay. So, do we have any idea how many hatchlings this nurturer is going to have?

#### TREXEL

Well, why not check the files?

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Zocroon 7 fact file.

#### TREXEL [muttering what he's reading]

...'round 600,432 or thereabouts for next year's hatch.

#### DAVID

Okay. Right, so, reasonably large, maybe the-

#### TREXEL

It's a reasonably large amount- not too many, though!

#### DAVID

So around the size of a moon?

#### TREXEL

'Round the size of a moon. Trough moon.

#### DAVID

Trough moon?

#### TREXEL

Trough moon.

#### DAVID

Put it in orbit around another planet?

#### TREXEL

Excellent, it saves on heating bills.

#### DAVID

Yes. Around a sun.

#### TREXEL

Around a sun! Boiling all the water with the power of the sun, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] means we don't have to deal with generators! I hate dealing with generators, David, I don't have to tell you! They're complicated, they break down, I don't understand them, I'm telling you-

#### DAVID

You're telling me. You're telling me?

#### TREXEL

I'm telling you, David!

#### DAVID

You're telling me.

#### TREXEL

Come onnn.

#### DAVID

Right. So, specific orbit, some sort of... boiling Goldilocks zone.

#### TREXEL

Mm-hmm, a Goldilocks zone.

#### DAVID

Yes. Not too hot, but still extremely hot, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] which is just right.

#### TREXEL

The specific Goldilocks for the person. I like it!

#### DAVID

A boiling Goldilocks.

#### TREXEL

##### [singing]

Do we need an elliptical orbit? Do we want to vary temperature throughout the year? In the summer it's hotter, in the winter it's cooler, but it's always a nurturing place! Come to the tentacle planet and you'll have a lovely human race! No, wait. Different race. What race is it?

#### DAVID

Superfluous tentacles.

#### TREXEL [threatening]

I'm getting tired of your attitude.

#### DAVID

Uh... I'm sorry?

#### TREXEL

Excellent. You're doing well. Okay! So we're having an elliptical orbit, so the temperature changes throughout the year. How long will the year be? I'm gonna say a week! Write that down. A week. A week.

#### DAVID

Okay, a- a year is a week.

#### TREXEL

A year is a week.

#### DAVID

A year is a week?

#### TREXEL

Wonderful thing about years, whenever you're building a-

#### DAVID

That's-

#### TREXEL

Wonderful thing about years, whenever you're building a new planet, you get to design how long the year is.

#### DAVID

That's very quick.

#### TREXEL

It's very quick.

#### DAVID

The water might spill out of the trough.

#### TREXEL

Where would it spill to, David? In space?

#### DAVID

Space. Yes.

#### TREXEL

Space, you're right. It would spill out into space and then we'll have to refill it, and then all of the monetary savings we make on the generators will be lost on water! Come on, David, you gotta *think* about this stuff!

#### DAVID

Okay! Maybe a slower orb- maybe a year should last... a year.

#### TREXEL

That's novel, but I like it, David, you're thinking, you're using that little bobble on the top of your neck that you seem to think is a head!

#### DAVID

I'm pretty confident it is a head.

#### TREXEL

Excellent stuff, confidence is my *king*! Are you my king?!

#### DAVID

Y- n- y- nnh, y-yes???

#### TREXEL

Board's wounds, you're no king of mine! There are no kings! No kings, only man and Board!

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

The Board, the Board!

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

Hail the Board!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Hail the Board.

#### TREXEL

So, an orbit is one year. I like that. I *like* that.

#### DAVID

Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

#### TREXEL

The water will stay where it needs to be- coming to think of it, as will the hatchlings! [__DAVID:__ Yes.] We don't want them spilling out across the solar system!

#### DAVID

Nurturer might not like that.

#### TREXEL

Ever had a hatchling hit you on your spacecraft's windshield when you're doing a *really high speed*?!

#### DAVID

I have never driven a spaceship and I have been in here for the last seven hours and that is all I can remember.

#### TREXEL

Neither can I, took my license away when I got drunk and killed that star, so we're on the same paaage!

#### DAVID

##### [affirmative Trexel noise]

Okay! Yes! Uh, so, we have... the orbit,  nice and boiling, [__TREXEL:__ Boiling!] uh, we'll have to get the, the, is it the build team?

#### TREXEL

*Don't* reference the build team directly, it *encourages* them! These recordings go straight to the build team, [__DAVID:__ Oh, we're recorded?] and it is their responsi- David, I am not a babysitter! We are building a planet, [__DAVID:__ But I'm a baby...] [incomprehensible] do I look like a planet, David?! You're a baby! You're a baby! Wah wah baby cry! Wah wah baby cry because baby needs a smack?!

#### DAVID

No!

#### TREXEL

Well then baby should shut its hole!

#### DAVID

Baby needs a feeding tube...

#### TREXEL

Feeding tubes are for-

#### DAVID [distressed]

I'm so hungry!

#### TREXEL

Feeding tubes are for winners, David, you know that! And currently, you look like a big sack of loss to me. Profit and emotion, David, profit and emotion.

#### DAVID

Demotion.

#### TREXEL

Emotion!

#### DAVID

Emotion.

#### TREXEL

Do you want a demotion? [__IMOGEN: [activation beep]__ Demotion requested.]

#### DAVID

I don't want a demotion! [__IMOGEN: [error buzz]__ Demotion denied.]

#### TREXEL

You can't be demoted, David, because there's nothing below you! Even the floor is above you!

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### TREXEL

Don't question me.

#### DAVID

...Yes.

#### TREXEL

Okay! So! We have the, ah, planet, now, we have the trough. Yes, David, and you know what, David?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

I think you were a big part of that. Well done. I'm really enjoying my time with you.

#### DAVID

Oh thank you.

#### TREXEL

Shush now. So, we need a way of getting the hatchlings into the trough, and out of the trough, without dying. Because if there's one thing that every species hates, it's the killing of their children due to unnecessary mechanics. I think we can all agree that.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Yes. So, how do you caaaarefully move a hatchling from the gentle boiling nursery area to the hot and frothy teenage area, out towards the conveyor belt of adulthood?

#### DAVID

Um, well, I came down a chute.

#### TREXEL

A chute.

#### DAVID

A chute.

#### TREXEL

A chute.

#### DAVID

Yeah, just opened up and dumped me into the room!

#### TREXEL

Mm, mm, did you enjoy that? Was it soft?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Did you have an egg? Did you have an egg around you?

#### DAVID

Um, uh, no.

#### TREXEL

Hm, hm, I worry that the eggs might crack if a chute just dumps something onto the floor.

#### DAVID

Right, so maybe a... very shallow chute.

#### TREXEL

A shallow chute.

#### DAVID

A shallow chute.

#### TREXEL

A shallow chute on a trough moon.

#### DAVID

Yes, the shallow chute's the shallowest-

#### TREXEL

Do you know how ridiculous you sound? A shallow chute. On a trough moon.

#### DAVID

Y-yes?

#### TREXEL

It needs to be a steep chute, but with a big cushioned surface at the end! [__DAVID:__ Ohhh. Yes.] This is basic stuff, David! I can't be expected to carry you through this process, you'll never survive!

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Steep chute.

#### DAVID

Steep chute!

#### TREXEL

Nice soft landing. Tell you what, David: Roleplay. [__IMOGEN: [beep]__ Roleplay holovision initiated.] You're a baby. Easy for you.

#### DAVID [holovision starting up]

Yes. It's me, David 7, the baby.

#### TREXEL

You're in a shell.

#### DAVID

I'm in a shell- I'm in a shell, I'm trapped in a shell.

#### TREXEL

Yes. Mime work, David, good mime work.

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Trapped in a shell, trapped in a shell.

#### TREXEL

Yes. You're rolling down a steep chute.

#### DAVID

Oh! Whoawhoawhoawhoa-

#### TREXEL

Sides are greased. S'nice and soft.

#### DAVID

Ssssss.

#### TREXEL

Yeees, that's how it is, that's how it is.

#### DAVID

Oh, this is very comfortable.

#### TREXEL

And as you fly out the end, [__DAVID:__ Wheee!] and you land on a wonderful pillow. You tumble gently into the next stage, splosh. Now you're an adolescent, how do you feel? You're an adolescent teenager.

#### DAVID

Um, I hate you, dad! [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] I'm gonna play my music far too loud, and it will confuse and scare you because it doesn't sound like the things you listened to when you were a teenager!

#### TREXEL

And that's because?

#### DAVID

I am angry? [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] And confused? [__TREXEL:__ Exactly.] And full of hormones!

#### TREXEL

Exactly, the Geistman three! Yes! So what we need is baffling. Sound baffling, 'cause what parent doesn't want more than to not be able to hear their teen?

#### DAVID

Okay! So, how long does it take superfluous larvae to... germinate?

#### TREXEL

Oh, Board only knows, I don't even know if we've got that on file. We're gonna have to work it out. Alright, so, ah, ah, uhh, what're these things, about a foot high, and it comes about in three foot high, how long does it take to do two feet?

#### DAVID

Uh, two feet?

#### TREXEL

Two feet of growth, come on!

#### DAVID

##### [spluttering]

Two feet of growth! I'm- I , uhhh-

#### TREXEL

You're gonna have to commit to something, 'cause it's going in the plan!

#### DAVID

Three years!

#### TREXEL

Three years, excellent! Then it's three years. Now, I reeeally hope you researched that well, David, because if you didn't this is gonna be an absolute disaster!

#### DAVID

Wait, no-

#### TREXEL

Three years, locked in! Okey dokie! So! You're moving to adulthood.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You've got past the awkward stage.

#### DAVID

Sure.

#### TREXEL

You've seen... genitals.

#### DAVID

Good. Yes.

#### TREXEL

You know what they are.

#### DAVID

Yes! I know what genitals are!

#### TREXEL

You're an adult now!

#### DAVID

Definitely know what genitals look like. Right. Um, I want my own form of transportation and I want to move out, mum, you're... stifling my creativity.

#### TREXEL

A space-port. A space-port with ready shuttles to take each new adult away on some sort of gap year!

#### DAVID

Yes! And, as a cult, they probably want to do some kind of mission thing!

#### TREXEL

I forgot all about the cult, David, you can't let me forget about the cult!

#### DAVID

I'm sorry! I- ooh, oh, no, I'm checking the brief, they also need toys! They need toys!

#### TREXEL

David, we're nearly at the end, David!

#### DAVID

I'm sorry!

#### TREXEL

That is an integral part!

#### DAVID

I was caught up in the roleplay!

#### TREXEL

This is falling apart like a wet face!

#### DAVID

I lived a life! I lived an entire life!

#### IMOGEN

Roleplay holovision terminated.

#### TREXEL

Okay. This is important, David.

##### [roleplay holo shutdown]

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

What's fun?

#### DAVID

What's fun?

#### TREXEL

What's fun? You get one object. It has to be fun, we don't have time to do more than one, we have to have one omni-toy [__DAVID:__ An omni-toy.] to allow fun for larvae, adolescents, and adults.

#### DAVID

Lots and lots of tentacles?

#### TREXEL

Yes, you've got loads of tentacles.

#### DAVID

I'm part of a cult.

#### TREXEL

Yes, superfluous tentacle cult.

#### DAVID

Aah, some kind of very complicated sacrificial dagger!

#### TREXEL

David. You're beautiful. Your mind is a poised sponge of information, and I am underneath, David, with my mouth open, [__DAVID:__ Agh.] and I'm squeezing, [__DAVID:__ Eugh.] and out comes *delicious morsels* of *wonder*, yes! A ceremonial dagger of deeply complicated design, kids and adults [__DAVID:__ Yes.] all can play with a dagger hilt for you today!

#### DAVID

Spatial learning, that's what I've been told!

#### TREXEL

Don't complicate things, David, let them interpret it and then you can't be wrong!

#### DAVID

Okay. So a big bucket full of very sharp objects.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

For the kids, well done David, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] I think we have absolutely *nailed* this one, [__DAVID:__ Really?] and by the looks of it, just in the nick of time, we're just running down. So! We need to submit this, [__DAVID:__ Excellent] pretty much now, otherwise we'll miss the deadline [__DAVID:__ Yes.] and you will be immediately recycled. [__DAVID:__ What?!] But of course you know how to submit this,of course David, I don't need to tell you!

#### DAVID

I- I-

#### TREXEL

David, I don't need to tell you.

#### DAVID [stuttering]

#### TREXEL

David, do I need to tell you how to submit a brief?

#### DAVID

Eeeeehhh...

#### TREXEL

##### [David spluttering]

Board preserve me, David-- Right, take the notes- the notes,  come on David! The notes you've been making!

#### DAVID

I have the notes! I have the notes!

#### TREXEL

Put them in a tube!

#### DAVID

Okay, okay, they're in the tube, they're in the tube now!

#### TREXEL

Yes David, and then what?

#### DAVID

I close the tube...

#### TREXEL

Come on David!

#### DAVID

And then I put- well, the cap- the, the, put it in-

#### TREXEL

Put it in the tube, David!

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID

Put it in the tube and I hit submit! I hit submit!

#### IMOGEN [brief going away]

Submitting.

#### TREXEL

##### [relieved David noise]

David, you've done it. You've survived, well done, David!  You know, 80% of the assistants don't, so congratulations!

#### DAVID

Oh!

#### TREXEL

Well done. Now, obviously we're not quite through the woods yet.

#### DAVID

Oh...

#### TREXEL

We've got an approval process to get through!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

Well, that will go to Hartro and the build team, she'll assess it for, ah, content regulation, and they'll assess it for engineering feasibility, and then assuming both of those work-

#### DAVID

The big trough.

#### TREXEL

The big trough, yes!

#### DAVID

The big trough full of boiling water.

#### TREXEL

And assuming it's absolutely fine and can be built without much difficulty, then you'll be absolutely fine and you won't die!

#### DAVID

...Oh.

#### TREXEL

Best of luck, David, I'll see you, ahh, probably same time tomorrow? Yes? Okay!

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Wait, but- no, what about earlie- no- no-

#### TREXEL

Well, excellent, have a lovely afternoon!

##### [door swooshes shut]

#### DAVID

Oh... ah. Huh... hoooh... ah... okay. Right.
