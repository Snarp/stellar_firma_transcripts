##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents__:__ Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

#### DAVID [sigh]

Right, so... I think it's been about... 23 hours now. Still in the dark. Umm... just the window... and void.

##### [door swooshes open]

#### TREXEL

Who in Board's name are you?!

#### DAVID

Aah! Um, David 7?

#### TREXEL

David 7?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### TREXEL

*David 7*?

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

David 7?!

#### DAVID

Yes, we met yesterday.

#### TREXEL

Yes, hello David 7, how are you?

#### DAVID

Uuh, I've been in a small dark room for 23 hours.

#### TREXEL

Ideal, that's your job.

#### DAVID

No, my job is helping you, and where *were* you?!

#### TREXEL

I was out! I was out with my friends, we went to the Cosmic Lounge!

#### DAVID

T-the little-- but the little shift beeper went.

#### TREXEL

The what now?

#### DAVID

The shift beeper went, like, six hours ago!

#### TREXEL

Ohhh, the nag-box on the wall of rules.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel laughing]

Yes!Right next to the--

#### TREXEL

We don't pay attention to that, David, it's just-- it's just judgemental! It's a judgemental box.

#### DAVID

But it now says we only have 20 minutes left until... things happen.

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

Only 20 minutes? [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Until our submission deadline? [__DAVID:__ Y-yes?] Well, that's a real doozy, I really hope you've worked real hard on the submission so far, David, because otherwise we have a very small amount of time to complete this.

#### DAVID

Bu-- but wha-- no, no, I couldn't, there weren't any lights! You turned off the lights!

#### TREXEL

Well yes of course I turned off the lights, to save power, this isn't-- this isn't some sort of *infinite sun*, David, we have power consumption as things to think of!

#### DAVID

But look, I can't turn the lights on! [__IMOGEN: [error buzz]__ Access denied.] L-look, I can't--

#### TREXEL

You need an access code to turn the lights on!

#### DAVID

I can't work in the dark.

#### TREXEL

Oh my god, you are *always* so *needy*! This one single day that I've known you, you've been the neediest person I've ever known. Right, I'll turn the lights on.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Access granted.

#### TREXEL

Happy now?

#### DAVID

Yes, I can see things.

#### TREXEL

Well, excellent, I can get the submission and let's get cracking, we've only got about 20 minutes!

#### DAVID

Okay? Right, here goes the button.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Initiating.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel chuckling]

Right. Okay. Um, so this is... from... um, Burn Market, the 23rd Earl of Armica. They are looking for a planet to be purpose-built for a plethora of reality holovision shows, and they demand that all of the landmarks need to have suggestive names. Suggestive of what I'm not sure, but, uh, I'm sure with your knowledge of the outside world, you'll be able to suggest a lot of things?

#### TREXEL

Yes, remind me, what was-- what was his name again?

#### DAVID

Uh, Burn Market, the 23rd Earl of Armica.

#### TREXEL

Armica. Yes, of course, Armica! That makes so much sense. Do you know Armica?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Excellent place, excellent place. It's full of, um, what do you call them? Blood sports. You know? Blood sports, and, sort of, like, oh, shows of evisceration, and sort of, you know-- just people generally fighting each other to death. So they-- they *need* these places, these sort of stadia, where they can project holograms and have people fight to the death-- it's fun, it's fun.

#### DAVID

So they want a death planet?

#### TREXEL

Well, yeah, it's a sort of like a, a, an arena deathmatch style planet.

#### DAVID

Riiight.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Okay. Um, how many stadia do you think we'll need? How big's the planet?

#### TREXEL

I'm gonna-- I'm gonna give you a little-- a *little* bit of advice, David.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Generally speaking, when you're building a planet, [__DAVID:__ Yes?] it's quite a big-- s'quite a big place, a planet. Otherwise, it's a *moon*. Are we in the *moon building* business, David? I-- I can't remember, are we in the *moon* business building?

#### DAVID

Um, I... genuinely don't know.

#### TREXEL

We're not, David. Moons are decoration and only come with a small additional fee.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So... yes, technically we build some moons, but that's not the point.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Mainly we build planets, it's going to be enormous.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Thousands of arenas, covering the surface of this planet, all with direct links to their home station.

#### DAVID

Okay, so, checking the-- the chart, [__TREXEL:__ Mm.] on the wall, of rules, [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] um, where does it range from 1, the tiny ball, to 10, the gigasphere?

#### TREXEL

##### [laughing]

Well,  let's not run before we can gigasphere, shall we? Let's go for a 4, which is pretty big.

#### DAVID

Okay. A "pretty big".

#### TREXEL

Pretty big. Not huge! Not *massive*. It's a planet, still. Pretty big.

#### DAVID

So we're looking at... a lot of stadia?

#### TREXEL

Yes, a lot of stadia. [__DAVID:__ Like a few thou--] Many sta-- stadia? Stadii? Stadiums? Stadio.

#### DAVID

Stadopidies.

#### TREXEL

Stadopidie.

#### DAVID

I think.

#### TREXEL

Let's call them__:__ stadfarms. Right, so we want *thousands* of stadfarms.

#### DAVID

Stadfarms.

#### TREXEL

Stadfarms, I'm sticking with it.

#### DAVID

Full of studs.

#### TREXEL

Full of-- look. When people fight, they're studs.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

You know? You look at them and think, man or woman, studs.

#### DAVID

Studs.

#### TREXEL

So we're gonna have absolutely thousands of these, David. Now, the main consideration we need to look at first is going to be__:__ climate. You can't fight if it's too hot, you can't fight if it's too cold.

#### DAVID

Ooh, ooh, but, but it does say a *plethora* of reality holovision shows. Now, having never seen a holovision before, I have no idea what they're like, but I would guess that if it were cold, you could see the fighters', um...

#### TREXEL

*Nipples*?

#### DAVID

...nipples.

#### TREXEL

Yes. That would be exciting, wouldn't it, David.

#### DAVID

And if it were hot, you could see the fighters', um--

#### TREXEL

Sweaty glaaands, David! Sweaty, sweaty glands. You're starting to get the hang of what a holovision show is.

#### DAVID

Oh really?

#### TREXEL

It's for perverts, David.

#### DAVID

O-oh.

#### TREXEL

You're already watching two, or maybe twenty people murder each other in cold blood. Why not also look at their sweaty glands? And their haaard nipples-- hard as diamonds, David, ready to cut the glass of entertainment!

#### DAVID

Okay, so that means we need a varied climate.

#### TREXEL

Very varied climate. Okay!

#### DAVID

And, ah, how 'bout wet? Do holovision viewers like things being wet?

#### TREXEL

Ohhh, they love it when it's wet, David.

#### DAVID

What about dry?

#### TREXEL

Oooh, even better when it's dry, so much sand in your eyes.

#### DAVID

Okay, so we need a hot-cold-wet-dry climate.

#### TREXEL

Yes, we might need to segment this planet pretty heavily with big climate walls.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

So we need a grid, David! Oh-- I love a grid, David. I love a grid. You've got a ball, it's covered in tiny squares, each one of those squares a world unto itself. A canvas on which you can paint each of your most extreme desires.

#### DAVID

Okay, so you're saying the Armica-- um, they love the death bloodsports.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

Right. What if each section of the grid is a stadfarm? With its own climate and... ruuules?

#### TREXEL

Oooh, that's an-- you know what, that's interesting, David, I-I don't really know how much we want to, you know, step on their business. [__DAVID:__ Okay.] You know, the rules are theirs. But you know what, I think the climate would allow for its own sort of in-built rules, if you know what I mean.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So if it's a really-- say you're in one of these...

#### DAVID

Stadfarms.

#### TREXEL

Stadfarms.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [electronic powering on sound]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

#### TREXEL [crosstalk]

And it is incredibly hot. Like, your-shoes-are-melting-to-the-very-ground hot.

#### DAVID

Very glandy.

#### TREXEL

Very glandy. Glands-- glands ahoy, that's what it'll say on the little crawl across the bottom of the holoshow. Glands ahoy!

#### DAVID

Here comes a bloodsport.

#### TREXEL

Here comes a bloodsport. "Glands ahoy, here comes a bloodsport" is exactly what it will say. And in that world, in that environment, there are some pretty core rules. You're gonna need water.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

But it's gotta be hard to find.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

Equally-- pan with me now, pan with me, David, you've got the holoset on. You've just been in this really hot place, it said "glands ahoy". Oh, ooh, even, even sitting at home, you're feeling quite hot now. [__DAVID:__ I'm thirsty.] You're thirsty? Of course you are! You're so thirsty-- it's so hot, there's so much sand.

#### DAVID [dry mouth noises]

Ooh, aehh.

#### TREXEL

But wait!

#### DAVID

Mm?

#### TREXEL

We pan away, we pan into another of the stadfarms.

#### DAVID

Ooh.

#### TREXEL

It's so cold, David.

#### DAVID

Brrr.

#### TREXEL [as David continues BRRR'ing]

All ice, barren wastes, glaciers, cliffs, and driving, driving snow. You thirsty still?

#### DAVID

For hot cocoa.

#### TREXEL

For hot cocoa, sure. [__DAVID:__ Yes.] Everyone's thirsty for hot cocoa. [__DAVID:__ Brrrr.] And you're cold, David, you're oh-so-cold, so what do you need?

#### DAVID

A-- a-- a blanket!

#### TREXEL

A blanket. Clothes. Warmth. So you see, [__IMOGEN:__ Roleplay holovision terminated.] each area has its own rules that we don't need to write down. Everybody knows if it's cold__:__ cocoa and blankets, if it's hot__:__ water. And, I don't know, fewer blankets.

#### DAVID

Fewer blankets.

#### TREXEL

Fewer blankets.

#### DAVID

Taking all the blankets off.

#### TREXEL

Not like-- you know, probably keep one, just in case, but don't keep them on.

#### DAVID

Ah. Right. Yes. Maybe you need it for some sort of combat blanket.

#### TREXEL

Exactly.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

You chuck it into somebody's eyes. They can't see! Ah!

#### DAVID

Aah! Uh, Trexel, just one thing.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

So, are all holovision shows... environment bloodsports? Like, I've never seen one, so-- so what are some names of popular holovids?

#### TREXEL

Ooh, that's-- that's a good question, David, because most of the ones that *I* watch, *me*, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] *I*, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] *me,* [__DAVID:__ You.] Trexel, [__DAVID:__ Yes.] mostly they're the bloodsports one. So there's Spattervision, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] there's, uh, uh, Knifeplay 24, um, there's The Guns... Of Death, [__DAVID:__ Right.] that one's quite gun-based, [__DAVID:__ O-okay, yes.] and also, BucketVision. What's the bucket full? Bucket of blood. [__DAVID:__ Ooh!] Yeah, that's quite a nice one. But you know, saying that, there are others.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

There are others. And I, I've never really considered them *real* entertainment but-- people seem to like them, but, uh, there's quite a selection of dramatic holovisions, ah, WeepVision, that's very sad, often people finding out that their loved ones have died, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] or that their family farms have become on fire.

#### DAVID

I-in a bloodsport?

#### TREXEL

Oh, often in a bloodsport, yes, they like to tie it back. They'll do a historical one as well, maybe they'll look at the first trade war of the Jeluvian Six, but then most of the characters who aren't on screen, it's heavily implied that they're doing a bloodsport.

#### DAVID [fascinated]

Right.

#### TREXEL

So, it's all part of the same Holomatic Universe, yes, but they-- y'know, they have different focuses. So, I suppose some of our grids *could* have, maybe, dramas in them.

#### DAVID

In... stadfarms?

#### TREXEL

In-- sure.

#### DAVID

Are all holovids in stadfarms?

#### TREXEL

Not all of them.

#### DAVID

Right. So--

#### TREXEL

Just the good ones.

#### DAVID

Are some of the grid-- *not* stadfarms?

#### TREXEL

Well, they-- they would be usable as that, but maybe one of them is like a biiig old-fashioned... parlor.

#### DAVID

From what you've told me, maybe-- maybe we have stadfarms... but we also have sadfarms.

#### TREXEL

Ooh. I like it, David. That's easy, because you've just changed a couple of letters, and then it saves on printing.

#### DAVID

*One* letter, actually.

#### TREXEL

Is it just the one?

#### DAVID

Yeah, the T's dropped.

#### TREXEL

I've never written it down before, David, so this is quite new to me. Good! Wonderful! I think we've really got our teeth into this. So we've got this planet, it's covered in grids, each grid is a different climate, some of them are for stadding, some of them are for sadding. We-- we're pretty much there, aren't we David, we're pretty much there, we can clock off early!

#### DAVID

N-no, the-- well, hang on a minute, I don't understand this, but they do ask for all of the landmarks to have suggestive names. Now, does each grid have to have a landmark in it? It-- it's got a climate, but then also like a thing? A gimmick for each holovision? Do holovision things have gimmicks?

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's all gimmicks. [__DAVID:__ All gimmicks.] All gimmicks, all the time. You know, it's really hard to keep people watching and interested.

#### DAVID

So as-- as you've explained, maybe one of them has a big burning... farm in the middle, and maybe one of them just has a gun that shoots death, and maybe just the bucket, the titular bucket of blood?

#### TREXEL

Yes, sitting in the center of-- of the stadium.

#### DAVID

I don't know how big the bucket is. How big's the bucket, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

S'a pretty big bucket.

#### DAVID

There we go! But what would it be called that's suggestive? I still don't understand the concept of suggestive, what's it suggesting?

#### TREXEL

Okay, well, umm-- this-- this might be a little bit new to you, David, you're-- you're a new clone, you haven't really... you know, understood many of the ways of the world.

#### DAVID

Yes. I am... 24 and a half hours old.

#### TREXEL

So that would be a bit early to know about all this stuff. But okay, so, you know... let's start close to home. You know humans.

#### DAVID

I am aware of them.

#### TREXEL

Just walking around, with our legs, and arms, and I hate to break this to you, David-- genitals.

#### DAVID

I've never walked, but I do know what genitals are.

#### TREXEL

Excellent. Now, a lot of what we do... is concerned. With genitals.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So much so that we've had to come up with loads of rules [__DAVID:__ Oh.] that mean we don't directly talk about the fact that so much of what we're doing is about genitals.

#### DAVID

Oh, I assumed they were just sort of... aesthetic.

#### TREXEL

You'd think that. You'd think that. You know, just, you know, like a piece of art that you also get rid of waste from.

#### DAVID

I did sit on one, uh, briefly, and that hurt.

#### TREXEL

That does hurt. You've gotta be careful of that. And as you get older, much-much easier to do that. Don't worry about that, though.

#### DAVID

Right. So when I'm 48 hours old, it might be really easy.

#### TREXEL

Exactly. So, we've had to, as a people, as a society--

#### DAVID

As clones?

#### TREXEL

As-- I'm not a clone, but I'm sure as clones as well, come up with ways of talking about it without actually talking about it. So, let-let's think of an example, umm... David.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Imagine you're a beautiful being.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [electronic powering on sound]

Roleplay holovision initiated.

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

Gender of your choice, don't really mind.

#### DAVID

David.

#### TREXEL

David. I'm trying... to entice you.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

But I can't just come out and say, "Hey there, would you like to... mash genitals together" or something similar.

#### DAVID

I don't see the point.

#### TREXEL

No, there'd be no point. So what I need to say is "Hey, how about you... come back to *my pod*... for a cup of hot, *hot* liquid."

#### DAVID

Ooh!

#### TREXEL

Exactly!

#### DAVID

L-like coffee? Or hot chocolate?

#### TREXEL

Exactly, could be.

#### DAVID

Specifically... with milk, actually, I'll have a white coffee, please, I've heard of this.

#### TREXEL

You see? You're already ready to come back to my pod, aren't you.

#### DAVID

For coffee, yes.

#### TREXEL

For coffee, and also... for *coffee*. Do you understand now, David?

#### DAVID

No, why did you do the thing with your eyebrows?

#### TREXEL

The coffee is also sex, do you understand?

#### DAVID

O- o*ooh!*

#### TREXEL

You see.

#### IMOGEN

##### [electronic powering off sound]

Roleplay holovision terminating.

#### DAVID

So it's when you want to say sex, but feel you can't say sex.

#### TREXEL

Exactly, you've got it, David.

#### DAVID

So the bucket of blood is actually a bucket of sex?

#### TREXEL

In a way. Sex, violence, violence, sex, it's all the same thing. I want to kill you, I want to kiss you.

#### DAVID

So the burning farm is a burning sex.

#### TREXEL

Ohh, look at all that property going up! I'm really attracted by that.

#### DAVID

The gun is not a gun of death, the gun is a gun of sex.

#### TREXEL

The gun is a gun of phallus.

#### DAVID [interested]

Ooh.

#### TREXEL

Exactly! So that is what we're talking about. So, these-- this group, being a bunch of perverts, y'know, they're all heavily into bloodsports.

#### DAVID

Oh, yes, we've established that about holovision.

#### TREXEL

We did. And they want all of their things to not only be violent, but also... [__DAVID:__ Sssexy?] suggestive. Yes, suggestive, which is sexy, you're getting onto it. [__DAVID:__ Right.] You know, sometimes you're saying the wrong things, and that is making me angry. But you're getting there, David, you're getting there.

#### DAVID

Good!

#### TREXEL

So let's think, let's take some examples. I want you to come up with landmarks, and I'm going to tell you their suggestive names.

#### DAVID

Um, a big pyramid.

#### TREXEL

Ooh. Four sides... of love? Keep going.

#### DAVID

Er, a giant tree.

#### TREXEL

Ah. Sprouting from the ground, thrusting down as well. How far do these roots go?

#### DAVID

These... feel more like suggestive phrases than suggestive names.

#### TREXEL

You are right, I've gone into a suggestive phrase rather than a suggestive name. Let's-- okay, okay, okay. Let's try this again. I can do this, I can do this! I've been training for years.

#### DAVID

This is literally your job.

#### TREXEL

This is literally my job, and it's right up my suggestive alley.

#### DAVID

'Kay. A big tree.

#### TREXEL

Bushels... of love?

#### DAVID

Um, a burning farmhouse!

#### TREXEL

Hot for action.

#### DAVID

A giant, spiked pit with rotating blades at the bottom.

#### TREXEL

I'll... sit on it.

#### DAVID

A mountain, but with a cleft.

#### TREXEL

Ooh. What's in my valley? Don't you want to know. Come on, come on, I'm getting into the flow.

#### DAVID

Um, a magical forest.

#### TREXEL

Aah. Wands ahoy.

#### DAVID

Okay, um, a giant animatronic hippopotamus.

#### TREXEL

Aah! Robo-rump is robo-plump.

#### DAVID

A, uh, very small board game, where the object is that you have to betray your friends.

#### TREXEL

A knife in the back, a knife in my sack.

#### DAVID

A giant penis.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, just that. Keep it simple.

#### DAVID

Okay. A large, springy bed.

#### TREXEL

Aah, jangle *my* rivulets.

#### DAVID

A statue made of ivory of Trexel Geistman.

#### TREXEL

Ah-hah! Take his tusk, smell his musk.

#### DAVID

...eugh.

#### TREXEL

Smell my musk!

#### DAVID

I don't want to smell your musk, Trexel.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Musk detected.

#### DAVID

Right, I think that's probably enough landmarks to be... going with, I assume they don't want us to, ah, name *every* single one, that would take absolutely ages.

#### TREXEL

No, no, the build team can handle a lot of those. You've just got the main ones, we've given the theme and they can move on from there.

#### DAVID

Okay, so, just to recap__:__ um, we have a Class 4 moderately big planet, it's been divided into a bunch of different squares, or stadfarms, or sadfarms, all across it, and each square has its own climate, which is hot, cold, wet, or dry, and, um, each one has its own landmark which is called some of the things that we just said.

#### TREXEL

Something suggestive.

#### DAVID

So just to recap, all of holovisions are either bloodsports or dramas.

#### TREXEL

Mhm.

#### DAVID

And there are no other kinds.

#### TREXEL

Or historical dramas, or historical bloodsports, or dramatic bloodsports.

#### DAVID

Right. So any combination of those, which means that you'll have sad-stadfarms, stad-sadfarms, sad-sadfarms, stad-stadfarms, stadfarms, and sadfarms.

#### TREXEL

Excellent, David, if you weren't here that would've taken me literally 40 minutes to work out.

#### DAVID

Oh, and it only took us, very approximately, 19 minutes and 40 seconds.

#### TREXEL

Absolutely, David. Wonderful. Well, you know what, this time, I think we-- we've still got a few minutes left, so is there anything you want to add to this planet? Anything you wanna know about planet building, you know, while we've got these few precious minutes together?

#### DAVID

Oh, the build team. Who're they?

#### TREXEL [inhale]

The build team. Now, the build team are very important. They are the ones that actually do a lot of the work, if I'm honest with you, David. We're the thinkers, the dreamers, the believers. They're the people that actually do stuff, build stuff, and make the planets work.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### TREXEL

So when you submit that little document you've got there--

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Would you like to submit?

#### DAVID [shrill]

Ooh! Which I have to now!

#### TREXEL

Oh, quickly, quickly!

#### DAVID

Aaah!

#### IMOGEN [chime, pneumatic tube hissing]

Submitting.

#### TREXEL

Once you've submitted that, that whisks its way off to Quality Assurance. They check that it all works, and that it's all functional, and then that goes to the build team and then they build it for the client, and then the post-sales support team will handle the rest of it there.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

You know what, I-- I've been really happy with how you've worked today, David.

#### DAVID

Oh! Thank you, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yesterday, I was pretty skeptical. You did an absolute hash of our first planet, [__DAVID: [dejected]__ Oh.] you really did, [__DAVID: [further dejected]__ Oh.] you know, I think I did my best in saving it but you-- you really hashed it up and I thought this-- this one? Not gonna last a couple of weeks. But you know what, I think you might last a couple of weeks! So, you know, that's pretty good going!

#### DAVID

A-- a couple of weeks?

#### TREXEL

Yeah, couple of weeks, before you get recycled.

#### DAVID

Wh-- recycled?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

W-- wait, what? No, hang on a minute, I-- I want to live longer than a couple of weeks!

#### TREXEL

Well then, you'd probably better get better at your job, then, shouldn't you?

#### DAVID [spluttering, panicking]

Wha-- what do I-- how do I-- how-- how'd-- ha--

#### TREXEL

David, David, David, David. Do you not understand what's happening here? You are responsible for my success-- if these planets don't work, well, then, clearly something's wrong. And it can't be me, so they'll replace you, and they'll recycle you, and then there'll be a David 8 sitting across from me having a very similar conversation to this.

#### DAVID [afraid]

Ooh. Umm--

#### TREXEL

But anyway! As you dwell on that, enjoy your evening, I'll turn off the lights, and I'll see you tomorrow! Bye!!

#### DAVID [crosstalk]

Wuh! No! Uh, Trexel, Trexel, the nag box, the nag box, can you-- a-- ah-- ah. Y-- ...oh.

#### IMOGEN [beep]

Sadness detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

Oh dear.
