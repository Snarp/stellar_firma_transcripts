#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [soft alarm chirping]

#### DAVID

##### [pushes back covers, turns off alarm]

##### [stretches]

##### [sniffs the air]

Ahhhh...  Well, that's the Trexel alarm so that was a good lie in  but time to get... on with the day and deal with... him.  It-- Wait, is that... slurry? Something's wrong. Something's... changed.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Warning: room controls overridden. Safety protocols disabled.

#### HARTRO

##### [over the speaker]

Good morning, David.

#### DAVID

##### [startled yelps]

Hartro! Ah! Oh! Oh, it's review day. Okay. Right, review day. Yes, um, Hartro, where are... you?

#### HARTRO

##### [chuckles, David nervously joins in]

Well, I'm-- I'm everywhere today, David. I've created something [__DAVID:__ Um...] special  for you and Trexel.

#### DAVID

Uh-- what?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Special is never good.

##### [footsteps approach, door swooshes open, low tone beeping]

#### DAVID

So, is this--

#### TREXEL

Oh, ah! There we-- Woah! What's going on in here? I d-- David, what's happening and what have you done?

#### DAVID

What? What?

##### [mechanical whirring]

#### TREXEL

Woah! Waa-ho!

##### [suction pop]

#### DAVID

A what-- where? What the--? Oh my!

#### HARTRO

Oh.

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

##### [low tone beeping stops]

##### [pounds on glass]

Okay.  I am trapped in a glass cylinder.  This is new.

#### DAVID

Um, a lot is happening. Hartro, what-- what surprise is this?

#### HARTRO

Hello boys and welcome.

#### TREXEL

Hartro, what is going on? Why am I in a cylinder? I am not a vial of liquid no matter how much you say!

#### HARTRO

Calm down. Any struggle will not get you out, it only--

#### TREXEL

##### [shouting]

I am calm! Urgh! Urgh! I'm so calm!

#### HARTRO

I have received the quarter cycle sales report. And--

#### TREXEL

Ah, I assume it's great.

#### DAVID

Oh, dear.

#### TREXEL

Millions of sales.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

A hundred million sales-- I'm going to say ten hundred million sales.

#### HARTRO

You would be wrong.

#### TREXEL

Okay, a hundred million sales.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

A hundred sales.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

Ten sales.

#### HARTRO

No. Lower.

#### DAVID

Three? Three sales.

#### HARTRO

No.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

*A* sale.  Hartro, surely *a* sale. We convinced one client that we were their god. Who doesn't buy from their god?!

#### HARTRO

Trexel, you've had *zero* sales.

#### DAVID

##### [shocked]

Zero sale-- zero sale-- I thought you were supposed to be an expert!

#### TREXEL

This seems at both times unlikely and also fits in with a pattern I felt I've established.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Cognitive dissonance detected. Security alerted.

##### [David sighs]

#### HARTRO

I am now forced to deliver terminal motivationonix. I, I have to admit, I will find some pleasure in this--

#### DAVID

Wait, that doesn't sound good.

#### TREXEL

It's not a good-- it doesn't sound good. It has the word 'terminal' in it.

#### HARTRO

##### [chuckles]

##### [dun dun duh!]

I like to refer to it as  the Gauntlet.

#### DAVID

##### [excited]

Ooooh! Ooh, that does sound fun!

#### TREXEL

No, David, I'm not sure this is a good thing.

#### DAVID

##### [dun dun duh!]

Yes, I would like to try to take... the Gauntlet!

#### HARTRO

Well David 7, I'm glad you're excited because it starts with--

#### DAVID

##### [dun dun duh!]

With a Gauntlet!

#### HARTRO

--you!

#### DAVID

Okay. Good.

##### [slurry starts pouring out of the machine]

#### DAVID

Oh, ohhh! What's happening to the slurry machine? Oh, it's-- oh, there's slurry everywhere!

#### HARTRO

The Gauntlet has begun!

#### DAVID

Ooh! Ah, it's really hot! Ow! Oh!

#### TREXEL

Thank goodness I'm protected from all this molten slurry by this big glass tube.

#### HARTRO

At the moment, Trexel. But you see, [__DAVID:__ Ooh! Ahh! Ooh! Eeee!] I've rigged the slurry machine to spew hot lava onto the office floor. And you, Trexel, need to save David 7--

#### TREXEL

But I'm in this tube. Wh-- I mean, why would I bother?

#### DAVID

Ooh! Ah! Eeee!

#### HARTRO

Well because eventually, if you look above you, there's a giant hole at the top of your tube.

#### DAVID

Ooh! Eee!

#### HARTRO

David 7, if he does die because you can't save him, [__DAVID:__ No! Please don't--] the lava will come up and go into your tube. So, look sharp!

#### TREXEL

I've now decided that I must save you, David. [__DAVID:__ Ah! Wha--] What do I need to do to save David, absolutely just David.

#### DAVID

##### [whimpers]

Ow! Ow! Ow!

#### HARTRO

At your feet you will see 6 children's wooden blocks.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### HARTRO

And on their surface they have either a letter or a number. You need to arrange them and stack them in the correct order to save David 7's life! Go! Go! Go!

##### [upbeat countdown music]

#### DAVID

Trexel, it's consumed my bed.

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

It's consumed my bed!

#### TREXEL

Quick question: is there a child present that can solve these children's blocks?

#### DAVID

You--! You're-- No, wait. Ow!

#### HARTRO

You, Trexel. You're the child.

#### TREXEL

Okay. I'm gonna get into the mindset of a child.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Hardly a big leap.

#### TREXEL

Okay, I'm small. I'm alone.

#### DAVID

There is not much space on this desk.

#### TREXEL

I've been locked in a dark room. And... ugh, this isn't helping. What could it possibly-- I need a clue, Hartro. I'm just stacking the blocks up now.

#### DAVID

No-- Trexel, are there letters on the cubes?

#### TREXEL

Yes, there are letters on the cubes.

#### DAVID

Okay. Rearrange them and maybe they'll make some sort of codeword or, or password.

#### TREXEL

##### [David cries out in pain]

Okay. Okay, okay, okay! Please stop shrieking. I can't think.  Okay. You can do this. You can do this. The letters are V, A, D, I, D and there's also the number 7.

#### DAVID

Ok--

#### TREXEL

What could it mean?

#### DAVID

Trexel--

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Likelihood of clone death: 65%.

#### DAVID

Trexel, I-- I think it's my name.

#### TREXEL

Okay--

#### DAVID

Trexel, David 7. David 7!

#### TREXEL

Okay, let's try it like this. Um, it's AVIDD with 2 D's 7.

#### DAVID

Trexel, David 7.

#### HARTRO

Try it! Try it, Trexel! See if it works!

#### TREXEL

Okay, I'm trying it. I'm trying it.

##### [error buzz]

#### HARTRO

Nuh-uh!

#### DAVID

Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

#### TREXEL

Nah. No, that's not work-- Okay. Okay.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

70%.

#### TREXEL

##### [stammers]

I'll do this.  Okay.

#### DAVID

It's David 7!

#### TREXEL

Okay. It's VID... AD! VIDAD! VIDAD 7.

#### DAVID

David 7!

##### [Trexel mutters while putting the blocks together]

##### [error buzz]

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

No, no, that's not all--

#### DAVID

Trexel.

#### HARTRO

Ooh, David's getting a bit hot under the collar over there!

#### DAVID

Oh, um... I'm on the shelf now.

#### TREXEL

I've got it! I've got it! Everybody calm down. I've got it. If I turn this 7 over it's an L and it's LAVIDD with 2 D's.

##### [error buzz]

#### DAVID

No, Trexel. David 7.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

80%.

#### TREXEL

This is impossible, Hartro. You're just murdering us at this state. I need a clue.

#### HARTRO

You've done it to yourself, Trexel.

#### DAVID

This shelf is really thin. It's David 7, Trexel. The answer is David 7.

#### HARTRO

What could it be?

#### TREXEL

Wait. Wait.

#### HARTRO

What could it be?

#### TREXEL

David, are you trying to tell me something?

#### DAVID

Yes. The answer is David 7.

#### TREXEL

No, I know the answer can come from David 7. Tell me, David.

#### DAVID

##### [Hartro laughs]

No, the answer *is* David 7!  There are 6 blocks.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

D A V I-- Ooh!-- D 7.

#### TREXEL

There's no block with 'Ooh' on it, David. That's ridiculous!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

85%.

#### DAVID

No. D A-- Ooh!-- I D 7.

#### TREXEL

You've just moved the block, David! This still doesn't work! There's not enough blocks!

#### DAVID

David 7! D A V I D 7.

#### TREXEL

##### [error buzz]

D A I V--  Nope. No, I've-- I've done it wrong!

#### DAVID

D A V I D 7!

#### TREXEL

##### [error buzz]

D V--  Agh! I've-- hang on!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

90%

##### [David yelps in pain]

#### TREXEL

D A V I D 7.

##### [triumphant tone]

#### HARTRO

Ah! Yes. You've done it.

#### TREXEL

Ahhh!

##### [David's whimpers grow less distressed]

#### HARTRO

##### [Trexel sighs]

Let me push this button right here...  and alleviate some of that lava for you.

##### [lava slurry drains out of the room]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Likelihood of clone death returning to normal levels: 50%.

#### TREXEL

Wow.

#### HARTRO

And I'm going to lift your tube, Trexel.

##### [low tone beeping, tube unsuctions, swooshes away, latch closes behind it]

#### TREXEL

##### [relieved sigh]

##### [low tone beeping stops]

You know what?  I'm glad to be out of the tube but I miss its security.

#### HARTRO

Well, don't worry. There's more fun times planned.

#### DAVID

##### [shaken]

##### [dun dun duh!]

Is there any more to... the Gauntlet!

#### HARTRO

Oh, yes! Yes, plenty, plenty more! But first of all-

#### DAVID

Half my onsie's burned off.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Clone buns detected. Security alerted.

#### TREXEL

David.

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

David, you're exposed.

##### [slap]

#### DAVID

Ah! Woooh!

#### TREXEL

David, I'm gonn--

#### HARTRO

Find something, please.

#### TREXEL

I'm going to tear the hem of mine because, as much as I don't want to interfere with my suit, we don't need this in our lives.

#### DAVID

Um, okay!

#### TREXEL

##### [tears fabric]

Hang on.

#### HARTRO

I mean, what even is that?

#### DAVID

Eugh!

#### TREXEL

Just put this on as some sort of...

#### DAVID

Um, loin cloth.

#### TREXEL

Loin cloth.

#### DAVID

Ooohhhh!

#### TREXEL

To cover your loins!

#### DAVID

Eughhh. Loins covered.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Further clone loinery will not be tolerated.

#### HARTRO

##### [dun dun duh!]

I think that's a nice look for the Gauntlet.

#### DAVID

Um--

#### TREXEL

##### [struggles while ripping fabric]

It's very sort of tribal. You know what?

#### HARTRO

##### [disgusted]

Oh! Eugh!

#### TREXEL

I'm here with you, David.

#### DAVID

Dear Board!

#### HARTRO

Eugh.

#### TREXEL

Joined in tribal dress.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Unwarranted and unwanted. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

##### [dun dun duh!]

What is the next dangerous Gauntlet thing?

#### HARTRO

Well, luck for us all, uh, Trexel, you need to put on the winner's jacket.

##### [mechanical whirring, clicks]

#### TREXEL

Oh, well. You know what? This is the kind of game I like. Ah, there's-- ah, this is a jacket suspended in the air!

#### HARTRO

That's it there.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Oh, it's got a-- some sort of hanger and a rope.

#### HARTRO

Leave that! Leave that in!

#### TREXEL

Oh!

#### HARTRO

Leave that in!

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Oh, leave the hanger in?

#### HARTRO

Yes, please.

#### DAVID

T-Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Hm?

#### DAVID

##### [dramatic]

##### [dun dun duh!]

Trexel, no-- I think the jacket is gonna winch you into there and I think it's part of  *the Gauntlet!*

#### TREXEL

##### [sighs]

David, I, I don't think that's the case. We-- we've completed-- well, I've successfully solved the puzzle [__DAVID:__ No. No. ] and completed the first challenge. And, as a thank you, in good faith, I am being given a winner's jacket. [__DAVID:__ Okay. Tr-- Tr--] Which, given that I've torn off most of my clothes to make this loin cloth--which seemed fun at the time but now my top half, a little bit chilly--I'm actually quite thankful for. Thank you, Hartro. Thank you for this jacket.

#### DAVID

Ok-- I, I--

#### HARTRO

Yeah, you're welcome. Make sure you button it up.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sighs nervously]

Okay. Will do.  Okay, so David--

#### DAVID

Well, it covers those nipples up, so I can't argue with that, but this is a terrible idea and you shouldn't do it.

#### TREXEL

Well, we will see, won't we, David?

#### DAVID

Yes, we will.

#### TREXEL

Okay. We will.

#### DAVID

Okay. Put it on then.

#### TREXEL

##### [struggles putting the jacket on]

Right. Okay.  I'll just button this up here.

#### HARTRO

Nice and tight.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, it's a very nice style. Hm, cut just for me! Thank you very much--

__[Trexel cries out, the rope attached to the jacket is wound in, comical__ __'whoopsie' tone]__

#### HARTRO

Oh! Welcome to the ceiling of fears!

#### TREXEL

I'm at the ceiling and it's called "ceiling of fear" which doesn't sound good.

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastically]

Who could have thought that this might happen?

#### TREXEL

Hartro, what's happening?

#### HARTRO

##### [maniacal cackle]

Oh, you're just up in the ceiling of fears where you will hear all the criticisms that you justly deserve, that you should have been told your whole life and now they will all be coming upon you all at the same time right now. Right now!

##### [whispers begin]

#### TREXEL

##### [listening to the whispers]

Oh-- What-- Oh-- What-- Oh. Oh! Oh! No, that's harsh! That-- that's-- That is unproven. I--

#### DAVID

Uh, Hartro, is he just up there forever or is there something I can do to solve it?

#### HARTRO

##### [chuckles]

Oh! Oh, yes. Yes. Oh, yes, yes. I forgot that part. I was-- I was enjoying the show.

(__TREXEL:__ I didn't know they were in there!)

#### DAVID

##### [dramatic]

##### [dun dun duh!]

No, I know. I mean, this is pretty good, honestly. (__TREXEL:__ No.) I like this part of  *the Gauntlet!*  But you know...

#### HARTRO

Would you like to try to save him?

#### DAVID

Uhhhhhm...

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Oof! Tough call detected. Security sympathetic.

#### DAVID

Is there a puzzle to solve?

(__TREXEL:__ Okay, no one proved that.)

#### HARTRO

##### [statues lowered, low tone beep when they reach the ground]

Yep. Well, I've got some statues you see there. They're, they're being lowered [__DAVID:__ Right.] onto the floor. And... there you go.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### HARTRO

##### [spotlights over plinths switch on]

Um, if you take those statues [__DAVID:__ Mm-hmm.] and you put them on the plinths  that are now being revealed around the room...

#### DAVID

Oh, right. Okay, this--

#### HARTRO

In the, in the right order.

#### DAVID

Okay, so label-- okay, so the plinths label 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, (__TREXEL:__ That was the one time!) and 6. Okay. Um... these statues all look the same! I mean, I'm just gonna have to--

#### HARTRO

Yep.

#### DAVID

##### [statues clank as David places them on the plinths]

Right, okay well. Uh...  Eh... eh... nah... nah... nah... [__HARTRO:__ Ohhh, I see what you're doing there.] neh. Huh! Eh!

#### HARTRO

##### [clicks tongue]

Nnnnn-- Ah!  No--

#### DAVID

Any-- anything?

#### HARTRO

##### [error buzz]

No. No!

(__TREXEL:__ No one could have possibly have seen that!)

#### DAVID

Okay... Um...

#### HARTRO

Sorry, David 7, it just doesn't seem to be working. I'm--

#### TREXEL

David! David, please! David, this is a lot more unpleasant than I thought it would be!

#### HARTRO

Are you crying, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

##### [sobs]

A little bit!

#### DAVID

##### [statue hits Trexel]

Okay, Trexel. Well, you know, I-I'm just-- so, I'm really stumped here so maybe *you* can try and solve one of these. Look here-- Here's a statue for you. Nyah!

#### TREXEL

##### [statue falls on the floor]

Ow!

#### HARTRO

Ooh! Right in the loin cloth!

#### TREXEL

David, my arms are very much pinned up in this jacket so--

#### DAVID

##### [click]

Oh, dear. Well, I'll just pick it up off the floor where you dropped it  and-- Wait, hang on a minute. There's a-- there's an R on it.

#### HARTRO

Oh.

#### DAVID

Wait--

#### TREXEL [stammers]

It's-- the word is "regal"!

#### DAVID

Okay, that's, that's got 5 letters and there's 6--

#### TREXEL

The word is "reveal"! No, sorry, "revel".

#### DAVID

Nope. Ah, well, that first one was correct and that second one was... wrong. Um, so there's a-- okay, there's a, there's an R, uh--

#### HARTRO

Ooh hoo hoo, this is so much fun!

#### DAVID

T... Oh, there's an X. (__TREXEL:__ No, my mother used to say that.) Okay, well there's not-- there's not really many words with an 'X'. It's T R E X-- It's probably--

#### TREXEL

"Excellent"! It's "excellent", David!

#### DAVID

It's probably-- That's not got a--

#### HARTRO

I think-- I think he thinks it's "excellent".

#### DAVID

No, there's no R in excellent, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Erxcellent!

#### DAVID

Okay, that's not a word, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

You're not a word!

#### DAVID

And there are a lot more than-- Okay. Uh... right. So, so Hartro, it's, it's Trexel, right?

#### HARTRO

##### [sing-song]

It might be.

#### TREXEL

That doesn't-- that's too simple, David!

#### DAVID

The last clue was "David 7".

#### TREXEL

So she couldn't possibly do that twice. It's like putting A for every answer on a test. You do it A B C, A B C. That's how I passed all my exams.

#### DAVID

You know what, Trexel? You're right. I really need to think about this one.

#### TREXEL

Think about it, David!

#### DAVID

Yeah, I will. Uh--

#### HARTRO

'Cause you, you don't want to get it wrong. [__DAVID:__ No, I--] If you get it wrong, absolutely nothing happens, he just stays up there longer.

#### DAVID

Oh no!

#### HARTRO

But you wouldn't want to get it wrong just 'cause...

#### DAVID

It's just really a shame, isn't it?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

Yeah.

#### HARTRO

It's your pride really.

(__TREXEL:__ Ooh, that's harsh. That's harsh. That's a bit harsh.)

#### DAVID

Um, so... Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Yes.

#### DAVID

Uhhhh... this, um, terminal motivationonix, right?

#### TREXEL

Please David!

#### HARTRO

##### [dun dun duh!]

The Gauntlet.

#### DAVID

##### [dun dun duh!]

The Gauntlet!  Yes, um, so... this is very elaborate. How did-- Did you--

#### HARTRO

What?

#### DAVID

Did-- did you--

#### HARTRO

Huh?

#### DAVID

Did you break in and build this?

#### HARTRO

What? What?

#### DAVID

This wasn't just all in the room, right? The room changed, right?

(__TREXEL:__ Easy now. Easy.)

#### HARTRO

Yes. I mean, obvious-- obviously the room's changed. I'm changing the room. I'm in control of the room. I have--

#### DAVID

So you came-- you built this?

#### TREXEL

My arms are going numb.

#### HARTRO

Okay, you might want to start doing the-- your-- are you gonna do your job there, David 7?

#### DAVID

Oh-- oh, no. Fine. Fine, yeah, alright.

#### HARTRO

Do you want to go onto the ceiling of fears, David 7?

#### TREXEL

My feet have gone numb but I think that's unrelated.

#### DAVID

##### [statue clanks]

Uhhhh... no... I don't. So I'm gonna just put this--  T R E X E-- Trexel?

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

What do-- I've got T R E X E. What do you think-- what do you think is going on the last plinth?

#### TREXEL

Put the T at the end again.

#### DAVID

##### [statue clanks]

Okay.  Right. LREXET. Yep.

##### [error buzz]

#### HARTRO

Ah, that's not it!

#### TREXEL

No, I've got it! It's "Trexel"! It's "Trexel", David!

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastic]

Well, you're a genius, Trexel!

#### HARTRO

Oh, no.

#### DAVID

Incredible.

#### TREXEL

Please, put the statue there!

#### DAVID

##### [statues clank]

Right, I'll just swap these 'round.  And T R E X E L, Trexel!

##### [triumphant tone]

#### HARTRO [disappointed]

Ohhhh...

##### [rope winches back out, Trexel sighs in relief]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Consultant released. What a shame.

#### TREXEL

##### [takes off jacket]

##### [puts jacket on]

Ah, this jacket betrayed me.  Get off me! Get off me you betraying demon! Oh, but the cut is quite nice. I'm just gonna try it back on one more time.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel cries out, the rope attached to the jacket is wound in, comical 'whoopsie' tone, brief low tone beeping]

##### [sighs]

It-- it's gonna-- it's gonna--  Okay. I'm--

#### TREXEL

David, I think you might have to just put that-- [__DAVID:__ Okay, I'm just--] Take the statue out and just put it back in again.

#### DAVID

Just gonna pick up an R.

#### TREXEL

Yep.

#### DAVID

##### [statue clanks]

Yep, down it goes  again.

##### [Trexel cries out as he's winched back down]

#### HARTRO

Now--

#### TREXEL

##### [starts to put jacket back on]

I don't-- Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice-- I think I'd look good in that. Let me just pop that back on.

#### HARTRO

Put that jacket down!

#### DAVID

No-- okay-- Trexel.

#### TREXEL

What?

#### HARTRO

Put the jacket down!

#### TREXEL

Could I take it off the hanger and keep it?

#### HARTRO

##### [sighs deeply]

I think you'll find that you might be *busy* right now.

#### DAVID

Umm...

#### TREXEL

Oh. Busy how?

#### DAVID

##### [dramatic]

##### [dun dun duh!]

Is this a third *Gauntlet*!

#### HARTRO

##### [dun dun duh!]

Yes, it is the third Gauntlet.  The best and the last.

#### DAVID

##### [apprehensive]

Okay.

#### HARTRO

##### [maniacal laugh]

I like to call this one the "buzzsaw of contrition".

__[low tone beeping, hatch doors mechanically open,__ __buzzsaw starts up____]__

#### DAVID

##### [panicking]

Okay. Oh! Wha--! Wha--! Ah!

#### TREXEL

It would appear that our feet have suddenly become clamped to the door. [__DAVID:__ Um, there's--] Is this a good sign, David?

#### DAVID

There is a-- there is a saw. There is a saw.

#### TREXEL

I can't see a saw.

#### DAVID

There-- Look, look, look there!

#### TREXEL

Where?

#### DAVID

There!

#### TREXEL

Where?

#### DAVID

Right there!

#### TREXEL

Sorry, I had my eyes closed. Where?

#### DAVID

Right, open your eyes, look where I'm pointing.

#### TREXEL

Oh, that's a--

#### DAVID

The large saw.

#### TREXEL

##### [alarmed]

David, there's a-- there's a buzzsaw coming out of the wall!

#### DAVID

Yes. Um... Um...

#### TREXEL

That cannot be up to health and safety standards.

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Let me check the manual.

#### DAVID

Uh-- You've got the--

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

#### HARTRO

You'll find nothing in the manual, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

IMOGEN show me the manual. Search find "buzzsaw".

#### IMOGEN [beep]

##### [error buzz]

Searching safety manual for: buzzsaw.  Error. Safety manual not found.

#### TREXEL

Well, there's nothing in the rule book so I'm gonna allow it. Play on!

#### DAVID

Ah-- wha-- Um, okay. Uh, right.

#### HARTRO

Trexel, you have been the bane of my life.

#### TREXEL

Thank you.

##### [David whimpers]

#### HARTRO

##### [stutters]

You have everything handed to you [__DAVID:__  It's getting closer.] like a little morsel on a plate.

#### DAVID

It's getting closer. Um--

#### TREXEL

Mm, morsels.

#### DAVID

Hartro--

#### HARTRO

Just an idiot stumbling through their life--

#### DAVID

What's the solution, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

--getting *every single thing* that you wanted. You don't have to work for anything! Whereas some of us have to try!

#### DAVID

Hartro--

#### TREXEL

I'm yet to hear a criticism made. This--

#### DAVID

Hartro, I'm not with him. I'm not with him. What's the solution, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

You come as a pair, David 7!

#### DAVID

No! I'm not with him! He's with-- he just appeared at me.

#### TREXEL

David, are you trying to abandon me in my hour of need?

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### HARTRO

I just want to say... I won't miss you when you're gone!

#### DAVID

No! No no no no no no no! Not like this! I can't go like this. Please!

#### TREXEL

Hartro.

#### DAVID

Please, Hartro!

#### TREXEL

Hartro.

#### DAVID

Please.

#### TREXEL

Hartro. Hartro, can I just speak to you for a moment?

#### HARTRO

##### [maniacal laugh]

You can try but I'm so far gone!

#### TREXEL

Hartro, how long have we known each other? How long have we known each other, Hartro?

#### HARTRO

Years. Painful, painful years.

#### TREXEL

##### [starts crying]

Painful, painful years. [__DAVID:__ Please, Harto. ] And we've always seen it through together, haven't we?

#### HARTRO

##### [sobs]

We've never! [__DAVID:__  Please, Hartro!] I've hated you *the whole time*!

#### TREXEL

Every day, I've been there for you.

#### HARTRO

You have not. You've been there like a pimple on my butt!

#### TREXEL

##### [Hartro sobs then starts laughing]

When you've been sad, when you've been-- you've been having a tough day,  you turn around and who's there?

#### DAVID

##### [grunts while trying to bite through locks]

I'm sure I could bite through these locks.

#### HARTRO

You but not for any longer, Trexel! Not for any longer!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Unsanctioned maniacal intent detected. Likelihood of clone death: 100%. Level unacceptable.

##### [Hartro laughs maniacally]

#### TREXEL

##### [David continues struggling with the locks]

Remember that time I organised a picnic but then didn't invite-- No, you wouldn't know that because I didn't invite you. Remember that time when you banned me from the parties and then they got better.  That was all me!

#### HARTRO

Revenge is so sweet, and it's going to be painful for you.

#### TREXEL

##### [David sobs loudly]

David, I've done my best, [__DAVID:__ Trexel! ] but my powers of persuasion have not worked. [__DAVID:__ Ah-a, please!] It appears, David, we are going to die.  You know what, it's kind of sad given all we've survived over the weeks.

#### DAVID

You're very calm. You are very calm right now. Why are you so calm?

#### TREXEL

Because, David, I am always incredibly drunk.

#### DAVID

Oh, that explains so much. Please, just not like this! I'll take the blender, for goodness sake. I don't want to die with Trexel!

#### HARTRO

Goodbye boys!

#### DAVID

##### [sobs]

Noooooooooo!

#### TREXEL

David, I wouldn't worry. Things tend to just work out in the end.

#### DAVID

##### [exasperated]

That's not how life works!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Room controls reasserted. Safety protocols enabled.

##### [buzzsaw retracts, low tone beeping stops]

#### TREXEL

Well, there you go.

#### DAVID

What?! What? I know I'm alive but I'm so angry right now!

#### TREXEL

I told you, David, it always works out in the end.

#### HARTRO

##### [David hisses, Hartro hits buttons]

No! No!  My buttons! They're not working! What-- what-- what's going on?

#### TREXEL

I think you've been locked out, Hartro.

#### HARTRO

IMOGEN! IMOGEN, bring me back online.

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

#### HARTRO

Start the Gauntlet.

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

#### HARTRO

IMOGEN, start the Gauntlet!

#### IMOGEN

##### [error buzz]

#### HARTRO

What's going on?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Line manager command control revoked. Rescanning room systems. All systems contaminated by Standards terminal worms.

#### TREXEL

Standards?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

Why is Standards getting involved in-- Oh, it's old David 7's favourite of Standards, is it?

#### DAVID

No! What? That w--

#### TREXEL

Turn the buzzsaw back on. I don't want to live if I'm not the center of attention!

#### HARTRO

I can't turn it on!

#### DAVID

##### [sighs deeply]

Right, well, unfortunately, Trexel, it looks like we're just alive, but... Hartro, did you just-- You straight up just tried to kill us.

#### TREXEL

There wasn't a solution to that puzzle. It was just murder.

#### HARTRO

##### [breathes heavily]

##### [sobs]

I know.  You deserved it. It was my time! It was my time!

#### DAVID

To do a murder?

#### HARTRO

To get rid of you once and for all.

#### TREXEL

David, David, let me handle this. I know how to deal with people.

#### DAVID

##### [scoffs]

Goodness sake.

#### TREXEL

Hartro. Hartro. You okay, hun?

#### HARTRO

Don't you "hun" me, Trexel!

#### TREXEL

No, no. No, you misunderstand. I mean like Attila the Honeybee. That big bee that conquered China.

#### HARTRO

Why won't my saw work?!

#### DAVID

Um... Hartro, I think you might just-- Um, IMOGEN showed me some, some really nice lessons on the console. Uh, this sort of, um, mindfulness therapy. It helps you really work with a lot of stressful situations. Maybe just--

#### TREXEL

And I've found, I've found an abandoned room that you can just hit old metal with a bat, and that helps me.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### HARTRO

##### [defeated]

This is the only thing that was going to help me.

#### TREXEL

So, does that mean that just from now on in we've got a murderous line manager that's gonna try and kill us every week?

#### HARTRO

##### [speaker disconnects]

Yes! I'll get you! Oh, mark my words, I'll get you next time, boys!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Comms link terminated.

#### TREXEL

Oh... Well, she's gone now.

#### DAVID

Um... so... we're just... so, we're just, like, something now? Standards have done "a something" and [__TREXEL:__ Da-- David--] we're gonna go elsewhere?

#### TREXEL

This is uncharted territory. We've only just been put in Sales and now apparently everybody wants to kill us again because-- And I find it very--

#### DAVID

Because you're terrible at sales!

#### TREXEL

I'm excellent at sales! And I should know, I'm me!

#### DAVID

No, you did zero sales! We did zero sales [__TREXEL:__ David. David--] because of your Ten Step Program to Sales *Suckanation!*

#### TREXEL

David. *We* did no sales together as a team. And at the end of the day, isn't that the most important thing of all?

#### DAVID

No. It's doing sales so we don't have Hartro *who tries to literally murder us*!

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

But at the end of the day, if somebody isn't trying to murder you for your poor performance and how it hurts them,  then surely you're not doing anything right.

#### DAVID

This is my second vector of murder. I now have *two* methods of murder!

#### TREXEL

More murder than you can handle! And that's what you get at Stellar Firma. More murder than you can get a stick around.

#### DAVID

So, what? Are we just gonna argue in this room together or, you know-- What's gonna be happening?

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Contamination critical. Room cleanse impossible. Enacting Plan B.

##### [floor mechanically opens, Trexel and David yell as they are sucked down a tube]

#### TREXEL

##### [far away]

Wheee!

#### DAVID

##### [far away]

Not again!

##### [floor slides back into place]

##### [show theme starts]
