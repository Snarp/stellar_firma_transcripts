# __EPISODE 49 - VAIN ATTEMPTS AND VENT DESCENTS__

## Transcribed 5/24/20 via stellarscripts on tumblr

##### [show theme]

#### IMOGEN

Rusty Quill presents: Stellar Firma.

##### [theme continues]

##### [David and Trexel struggle as they scuttle through the vents]

#### DAVID

Trexel...

#### TREXEL

Er, what? What?

#### DAVID

Tr-Trexel, do you know where we're going?

##### [both stop scuttling]

#### TREXEL

What do you mean?

#### DAVID

I'm, I'm pretty-- Well, I'm pretty sure we've been, we've been climbing through these vents for about 23 1/2 hours and--

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Well, I think we should probably be... well,  where the complaints go now, right? It's not--

#### TREXEL

What do you mean? I-- I've been following you, David!

#### DAVID

You're in front.

#### TREXEL

I don't understand. [__DAVID:__ You--] Look, the point is we're making progress and wherever progress is going, it's good. [__DAVID:__ No!] Progress for progress sake.

#### DAVID

Progress to where?

#### TREXEL

##### [loudly]

Progress to the *future*, David. To the bright, shining future in which I am an Executive sitting on some sort of large ceremonial Executive chair, and I'm assuming that through these vents is to that destiny, unless I've entirely misunderstood what we're doing here  *which is always possible, David!*

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Not just possible but likely.

#### DAVID

So you think we're gonna crawl through some vents and you're just gonna find an Executive position at the end?

#### TREXEL

Well, David, I've never understood the hierarchical structure--

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel sighs]

No. No, stop. This is all gonna be rubbish. No, we are trying to find the Complaints Department, right? Because we are expediting and we put things up the tube and nothing gets *done* and the gun walls are *empty*. So I want to know where this tube right here goes.  Where do our things go?

#### TREXEL

David, why are you so insistent on all of this? Why can't you just live in the nice, soft, warm embrace of complete ignorance that we have all found quite comforting over the eons?

#### DAVID

##### [with fake enthusiasm]

Because I have suddenly found out that potentially my entire existence is completely pointless!

#### TREXEL

All existences are pointless, David! That's why we shout so much. Come on, it's simple!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

A simple philosophy but surprisingly accurate.

#### DAVID

Oh. Wait, you think that, too?

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

That existence is pointless.

#### TREXEL

I-- Ah, you're not gonna make me think about it, David. I can tell you're trying to make me introspective and it's not gonna work. I'm extrospective, David, and proud. Proud, I say!

#### DAVID

I wa-- I wasn't. I was just a bit sad.

#### TREXEL

Extrospect-- Uh, uh, look at these walls. Aren't they grand?

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

Oh, fine. Right, we can't afford to do this in here because we'll never get out. Yes, Trexel, so--  Look, change subject. You are Captain Vent-times, right?

#### TREXEL

I am. I am Captain Vent-time.

#### DAVID

The old-- the old ventmen.

#### TREXEL

Admiral Vents himself.

#### DAVID

Trex-vent Geist-vent. That's who you are.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

Let's not push it, David.  I'm the creative here. I'm the creative.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Chief Executive of Vent-a Firma.

#### TREXEL

That's-- Well, I like that. I like that but I'm *too big to admit it*.

#### DAVID

Okay. Well, why do you spend so much time here? And also, since you do spend too much time in here, how do you still not have any idea where we're going?

#### TREXEL

Look, the vents are a mysterious place. It's only in a vent that a human being is truly free. Obviously, not in a physical sense, you're enclosed in a metal tube. And also, not really in a mental sense, because the claustrophobia is destructive in the extreme! But, outside of the physical and mental sense, you can only truly be free in a vent. Do you understand?

#### DAVID

No.

#### TREXEL

Okay. Well, the reason I spend so much time in the vents is because in a vent no one asks me to do anything because, largely speaking, they can't find me. "Oh, what's that? Something's on fire?" I scuttle in a vent. "Oh, what's that? Bills are in?" Scuttle in a vent. "Oh, what's that? They found the pit *and* the bodies?" Scuttle in a vent, David. It's a very simple equation. Responsibility plus Trexel equals vent scuttle.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Spurious algebra detected. Security alerted.

#### DAVID

##### [Trexel groans]

Okay. Well, now I'm in the vents too so I'm having to ask you  can you take us to where the complaints go?

#### TREXEL

Oh, you're harshing my vent vibe, David. You're harshing my vent vibe!

#### DAVID

Alright. Alright, well try scuttling away! I'll just scuttle after you!

##### [Trexel starts scuttling away with David close behind him]

#### DAVID

##### [menacing, sing-song]

Ooooooohhhh!

#### TREXEL

##### [struggling]

I'll kick at you! I'll kick at you, you scuttling follower!

##### [David and Trexel struggle with each other]

#### DAVID

Oh, ah, ah, ooh! Woo oow! Ooh oo!

#### TREXEL

You get away from me!

#### DAVID

Waa ah! I'm too slippery!

#### TREXEL

You're harshing my buzz!

#### DAVID

##### [struggling continues, slime noise]

Ooh, I'm gonna head him off!  Now I'm in front.

#### TREXEL

How did you get around me?

#### DAVID

Woah-o, the power of the slime!

#### TREXEL

##### [scuttling stops]

You slimy weirdo.  Alright, fine.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Fine, we'll play it your way, David.

#### DAVID

Alright.

#### TREXEL

You want to find where the complaints and solutions to those complaints goes.

#### DAVID

Yes!

#### TREXEL

And to do that we need to follow the little tubes.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

Now, as it happens, we've circled back on the tubes pretty close to where we started, I'm sure, because I can smell that really... hint of garbage that was a, was a real feature of the Expediting room.

#### DAVID

What?!

#### TREXEL

What?

#### DAVID

You mean you've been, you've been leading us in circles?!

#### TREXEL

I always go in circles, David. The circle is the finest of shapes, other than the rhombus, the sexy, sexy rhombus.

#### DAVID

That explains so much. Right, well, for once in your life could you please try and go in a straight line, maybe even a parabolic arc!

#### TREXEL

I can give it a go, David. But, luckily, these tubes appear to go in a straight line so if we go due that-a-way, I'm pretty sure we'll get somewhere at some point, [__DAVID:__ Okay.] and I can't be any more specific than that, nor would I want to be even if I knew.

#### DAVID

Wait, so is your solution you're just gonna follow the tubes?

#### TREXEL

Yes. What was your solution gonna be?

#### DAVID

Well... I was... The obvious thing is just follow the tubes so--

#### TREXEL

Well, then why are you complaining, David?!

#### DAVID

Okay. In which case, so that I can avoid any more Trexel shenanigans, I'm gonna go first!

#### TREXEL

Trex-nanigans. Off you go.

##### [David mutters angrily, vent scuttling resumes]

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

They are as inevitable as death... and performance reviews.

##### [David continues muttering]

#### TREXEL

So David...

#### DAVID

What, Trexel?

#### TREXEL

I've been thinking.

#### DAVID [irritated]

Oh, really?

#### TREXEL

I was a little bit alarmed when you ripped that hole in what was clearly quite a thick metal wall, [__DAVID:__ Yeah?] because I appreciate you've been exercising, David, and becoming a very dense and strong clone boy, but it was--

#### DAVID

Been doing a lot of upsies-downsies.

#### TREXEL

Exactly, and a lot of the ones where the bum nearly touches the floor.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### TREXEL

But that was a, that was a thick metal wall and you just tore a, a big rage hole in it.

#### DAVID

Yeah? So? It's-- Can you not do that?

#### TREXEL

No! No I can't!

#### DAVID

##### [grunts, metal rips, distant sounds of swirling screams]

Alright. Could you-- Can you do this?

#### TREXEL

Ah! You just punched a hole in the vent wall.

#### DAVID

Wait. Wait.

#### TREXEL

You spent one day in my vent world and you're already punching holes in the walls! Aren't you happy that you've harshed my buzz? Isn't that enough? Now you've gotta destroy things with your big violent arms?

#### DAVID

How about yes to both of those things? And, um, well actually, why don't we have a look through the hole and, and see what's there? It might-- it might be the Complaints room.

#### TREXEL

A little peep. Okay, let's have a look there.

##### [distant swirling screams get louder]

#### DAVID

Oh... It's some sort of... whirlpool.

#### TREXEL

Ah, well that, David, is to be, what we call, the Maelstrom of Ultimate "Woah There Buddy, Why Don't You Reconsider Your Actions Before We Properly Kill You?" It's sort of an intermediate punishment between putting you in an airlock or recycling you or something, you know, super deadly, but it's still pretty bad. You get shaken up in a big whirlpool.

#### DAVID

Oh, that, that explains why there's so many screaming people in there [__TREXEL:__ Yeah.] in pencil skirts and pantsuits.

#### TREXEL

Oh, I recognize them. They don't like me.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Hm.

#### DAVID

Uh...

#### TREXEL

Well, Maelstrom for them.

#### DAVID

Right.

##### [screams get quieter]

#### TREXEL

But, David, this must mean we're near the punishment deck and that is quite a low deck. You don't put punishments at the top, you put them at the bottom [__DAVID:__ Right.] and then that allows of, like, the hot and pointy things to fall downwards with speed.

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh... right. Well, let's move away from the punishment deck--

#### TREXEL

Let's push on.

#### DAVID

--kind of quickly in case somebody finds us, and then it's like a really, really short kind of, whoop! [__TREXEL:__ Yes. Pushed you right into the punishment.] Pushed you into a terrible pit of angry knife dogs or something.

#### TREXEL

Yes! Knife dogs! They got that idea from one of our planets, remember?

#### DAVID

Wait... do you mean... I invented the knife-dog pit?

#### TREXEL

'Cause people are like, "oh look, a lovely dog," and it jumps up and it's sliced you in the neck and face! So, you know, it's a really--

#### DAVID

That's what I said!

#### TREXEL

Yes. Exactly. And they listened and they built it.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

You can't argue with a good idea like knife dog.

#### DAVID

Really? So, so they actually used something... from, from one of our designs, and, and it went somewhere, and it didn't just blow up because Trexel ruined it!

#### TREXEL

No, it went into a horrible torture that's regarded as one of the worst. Well done, David. You contributed.

#### DAVID

Look, it's at least something, right? Okay? At least they listened to that and not the complaints where I'm actually trying to help! They, they took the thing where I was trying to help a murderer but-- where I was trying to help-- well, unconfirmed, unconfirmed murderer. Unconfirmed murderer. Maybe murderer of their band. Uh, anyway-- but--

#### TREXEL

Alright. David, David, David, David, David.

#### DAVID

Yeah-- What? Yes.

#### TREXEL

Have you ever heard the phrase "grasping at straws"?

#### DAVID

##### [halting]

I have not. No.

#### TREXEL

Oh. That's a shame. I was hoping you'd explain it to me. Anyway, let's move on.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Moving on has never been a strong suit for either of you!

#### DAVID

Wait a minute.

#### TREXEL

Hmm?

#### DAVID

##### [starting to panic]

Why-- why can we hear IMOGEN so clearly?  She's not in the vents, is she? She's in the vents! Why is she in the vents?

#### TREXEL

##### [uncovers the portable IMOGEN]

David. David, calm down. Calm down. IMOGEN can hear and see all but no, they don't just put speakers for IMOGEN's voice to come out of just in the vents. Who'd be listening to them, me? They clearly don't care about me, David! That's the one thing we've established. No, I have a portable IMOGEN.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

#### DAVID

Wait-- wait a minute. Isn't that the one from Sales?

#### TREXEL

It is, David. Well remembered.

#### DAVID

You're not supposed to have that, are you?

#### TREXEL

##### [chuckles]

No, I'm not.

#### DAVID

So you stole it?

#### TREXEL

Yes, I did.

#### DAVID

Okay. And, um, and you decided not to tell me about it because...

#### TREXEL

I don't understand.

#### DAVID

Right.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Stolen Stellar Firma property detected. Security alert blocked. I like the vent adventure.

#### DAVID

Okay. Good. Well--

#### TREXEL

##### [covers the portable IMOGEN]

But that's what that is. Pop it away.

#### DAVID

##### [sighs]

Brilliant. So, IMOGEN can... everything and--

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

--walls and...

#### TREXEL

##### [fondly reminiscing]

Well, if we got into some sort of scrape that we needed IMOGEN to get us out of.  Remember when Hartro tried to murder us?

#### DAVID

##### [sarcastically reminiscing]

Okay, yes, but also remember when IMOGEN tried to murder us.

#### TREXEL

I mean, it's a good point. If I had Hartro to put in a pocket to act as some sort of balancing force maybe I'd do that. But if I put Hartro in my pocket, I get a feeling that will end with feet in mouth. I can't quite work out how it will work from the pocket to the mouth, but, you know, she'll find a way.

#### DAVID

Please, please don't. Please stop talking about Hartro. I have a horrible feeling that she'll just turn up somehow--

#### TREXEL

##### [alarmed]

What-- what-- David, shut up!

#### DAVID

What?

#### TREXEL

##### [soft rustling, David gasps] [softly]

David, shut up! Listen.  What's that? There's someone else... in *my* vents!

#### DAVID

Oh no!

#### TREXEL

It's coming from here. It's coming from over here. Come, David. Come.

#### DAVID

##### [vent scuttling]

Okay. Right.  Ah, ooh, ooh. Oh, please don't be Hartro. Augh, I've only just got my mouth clean. Ooha, ooh, ooh. Ooh.

##### [papers rustling]

#### TREXEL

Ah! What is this... nest? David, David, get back. There's, there's rustling. There's rustling, David.

#### DAVID

Ooh. Ah.

#### TREXEL

Woah! Woooah. Oh, there's something coming towards--

#### ENOLA

##### [softly but urgent]

##### [Trexel and David yelp in surprise]

Get in here.  It's okay. It's okay. In here, you're-- they can't see you in here. They can't see you in here!

#### TREXEL

David, are we dead? I feel like we might be dead.

#### ENOLA

It's a-- You're with me. You're with me.

#### DAVID

Who are *you*? You're not Hartro. Ah! Where are your feet?

#### ENOLA

Who are you? How did you... find me?

#### TREXEL

You are encroaching on Trexel's vent world, whoever you are.

#### ENOLA

Trexel?! Trexel Geistman?

#### TREXEL

Ah, yes. You know me.

#### ENOLA

Yes. I wish I did not. You-- you terrible... piece of... manflesh. You smear of disgusting... badness. You...

#### TREXEL

Wow.

#### DAVID

Um, okay. A bit weak but I like the energy.

#### ENOLA

Who-- but-- well, who are you?

#### DAVID

David.

#### ENOLA [in awe]

David.

#### DAVID

Yes. David.

#### TREXEL

I don't like it when people say "David" like that. Why does nobody say "Trexel" like that? "Mm, Trexel, I like you."

#### ENOLA

David as in David 7?

#### DAVID

Uh, you-- Wait, you know me, too?

#### ENOLA

I've been in the vents for a long time.

#### DAVID

Okay, this has gone from nice to kind of scary. Uh...

#### TREXEL

Bit-- bit scary. Bit creepy.

#### DAVID

Why... why?

#### ENOLA

It's safe in the vents.

#### TREXEL

Okay. I wanna establish something.

#### ENOLA

You don't get to establish anything here.

#### TREXEL

What's your name?

#### ENOLA

This is my domain.

#### TREXEL

Alright. Fine, fine. Well, I'll just--

#### ENOLA

##### [shoves a leaflet at Trexel]

Take this, take this leaflet. Take this-- read this leaflet.  I'll put this leaflet on you! [__TREXEL:__ Alright, what's this?] G-- Take it. Take it!

#### TREXEL

##### [grabs leaflet]

Okay, I'm taking it. I'm taking it.

#### ENOLA

Good.

#### TREXEL

##### [reading leaflet]

Put it--  "The Board: If They Only Knew, Gosh They'd Be Cross." What is this?

#### ENOLA

There's something happening in Stellar Firma.

#### DAVID

Yes! No, there is something happening. [__ENOLA:__ Yes!] Stellar Firma's broken! [__ENOLA:__ Yes!] It's completely broken!

#### ENOLA

Yes, it's bad!

#### DAVID

Screw the Board! The Board is rubbish!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Woah now! There are no gun walls in the vents, but if there were, they would be *very* deployed right now.

#### ENOLA

Well, you-- you can't, you can't really say *that*, but--

#### DAVID

Ah, but you can, and I did. [__ENOLA:__ The-- well--] Well, the gun walls, but they're out of ammo!

#### ENOLA

The gun walls are out of ammo?

#### DAVID

Well, at least in the room that we were in.

#### ENOLA

I've not been outside for so long. The gun walls are only a memory.

#### DAVID

##### [uncertain]

Good? Wait, that means the gun walls aren't here. Yes. Screw the Board! The Board are, uh, big, [__ENOLA:__ No. No!] uh, stupid, uh uh, Trexels. [__ENOLA:__ Shh, shh! No. No no no no!] They're all a bunch of Trexels.

#### ENOLA

##### [leaflets rustle]

No, I'm sure they're not--  If I could just show them, show them these leaflets, they would understand.

#### DAVID

What?

#### ENOLA

They would stop all this, all this chaos and, and mad men sending terrible designs and making planets melt and horrible murders happen, and, and small--

#### TREXEL

I, I think this is a reference to my stuff, isn't it?

#### ENOLA

Yes, it is! That's why I hate you! Go away!

#### TREXEL

##### [Trexel and Enola struggle]

This is a-- this is a thing about Trexel.  "Hey now, how about we consider things more carefully." These are really weak leaflets. Weaklets, I call them.

#### ENOLA

You're a weaklet!

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Wow. Slam.

#### TREXEL

You're a weaklet.

#### ENOLA

##### [starts pushing Trexel]

##### [muffled]

Terrible-- you... get down. You get down. [__TREXEL:__  You go-- okay.] You get down in the-- You get down under the leaflets. David, now--

#### DAVID

Cor, that is-- there is-- that is deep!

#### ENOLA

--how 'bout you?

#### DAVID

Yes?

#### ENOLA

Yes. I've been writing these for a very long time, David.

#### DAVID

Right. Okay, and h--

#### ENOLA

I was hoping-- I c-- I could see you were different.

#### DAVID

Yes, I have malfunctioning subservience protocols.

#### ENOLA

Oh! Sorry to hear that... I think.

#### DAVID

##### [loudly]

No, that's good. That means I'm not subservient! It means I can say things like,  "I don't like the Board very much!"

#### ENOLA

##### [whispers]

You can't-- Shh! Shh! No. I'm sure they're benevolent. I'm sure--

#### DAVID

No. Mm...

#### ENOLA

They-- Look, nobody would build a company that works like this. That would be [__DAVID:__ Oh...] stupid. I mean, who, who would put money before lives? [__DAVID:__ Um...] Who would think that making the profit line go up was so important that planets should be destroyed? No rational person would think like that.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Have you met many people?

#### ENOLA

Do you know what I think?

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

I mean, I know I've been pushed under the leaflets, but I've got a couple of ideas about *all* of this.

#### DAVID

##### [David grabs Trexel, leaflets rustle, David yelps]

Um, I was, I was gonna say-- Wait, let me just fish him out. Hey, Trexel.  Hey, hey Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

Uh, so you've got a graph in front of you, right?

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

##### [stammers]

##### [Trexel shudders]

And you've got X and Y but it is flat.It is, it is going flat. But then--

#### TREXEL

Implying a lack of growth.

#### DAVID

But then, but then you see 50,000 puppies in front of you, right?

#### TREXEL

Okay.

#### DAVID

And you are told if you stamp on all of their heads--

#### TREXEL

I've stamped on--

#### DAVID

--the line go--

#### TREXEL

I've just started stamping. I've just started stamping.

#### DAVID

I didn't, see-- See, I didn't even--

#### TREXEL

##### [frantic]

I've just start--  Has the graph changed? Has it gone up? *Please*, let the graph go up!

#### DAVID

Actually, no. No.

#### ENOLA

This is why Trexel is terrible! He would stomp on the puppies but the Board would-- not if they knew-- They would only stomp on puppies if they didn't know that they were *there*.

#### DAVID

So they don't care enough about puppies to even bother to look if they're stamping on puppies?

#### ENOLA

Well, what if they were underneath a layer of bad... employees?

#### DAVID

So you're saying that there's, like, a bunch of Trexels and Hartros stamping on puppies and then stopping the--

#### ENOLA

Yes! Yes, and, and, and the Board is, is far away and up there where we can't see, but if we could get to them, if we could speak to them, they would, they would stop this.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Extremely wishful thinking detected. Security feeling kind of bad for you.

#### TREXEL

I don't think they would. I think they're pretty on board with it all personally.

#### ENOLA

##### [laughing]

##### [manic laughter]

I-- No. No no no. They couldn't be.  That would be--

#### TREXEL [joins in laughing]

That would mean your life was a lie, wouldn't it?

##### [Enola and Trexel continue to laugh]

#### ENOLA

That would be ridiculous.

#### TREXEL

Ah, yes. Yes. Life-- you're living a lie. Lie.

#### DAVID

Okay. Uh, wha-- Question, have you distributed these leaflets? 'Cause there are a lot here and I've not seen any of them [__TREXEL:__ Me neither.] in my very brief walks around Stellar Firma.

#### ENOLA

I've been waiting for the opportune moment.

#### TREXEL

And what would define the opportune moment in your opinion?

#### ENOLA

When I'm finished writing them. I have to have enough for all of the employees and there's only, there's only 15,000 here and there's 100,000 employees, so...

#### TREXEL

##### [switches jazz noir music on]

I mean, there's *a lot* more than 100,000 employees, but, you know, [__ENOLA:__ Oh.] I've got some ideas about why that might be.  It's old Detective Geistman to the rescue.

#### DAVID

Oh, no no no no. Where did you get-- where did you get that hat from? No.

#### TREXEL

##### [cigarette package crinkles]

##### [lights match]

He takes out a packet of cigarettes , lights one , [__DAVID:__ Don't! No no-- Trexel, Trexel--] realises he still does not smoke and flicks it into the void!

#### DAVID

Don't throw-- the paper-- don't throw it away.

#### TREXEL

##### [panicking]

Oh! Oh!

#### ENOLA

Won't it set the leaflets on fire?!

##### [fire starts roaring]

#### TREXEL

Oh! Oh!

#### ENOLA

No! Get him!

#### TREXEL

Oh! Oh! Stamp it out!

#### ENOLA

Why?! Why my work? No! No no no no no no!

#### TREXEL

Oh!

#### DAVID

##### [slime noise]

Wait, wait, slime to the rescue!

#### ENOLA

Oh! Eeh! Ah! It's out? It's out!

#### TREXEL

Oh. Oh ho. Ah. Ah.

#### DAVID

I've got it! I've got it! My slime is flame retardant!

#### TREXEL

Don't worry.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

He's like a slimy fire hydrant.

#### ENOLA

Oh.

#### TREXEL

##### [Enola and Trexel sigh in relief]

He's got the slime.  There we go. Well--

#### DAVID

So, I've got-- I've got-- A lot of your leaflets--

##### [music switches off]

#### ENOLA

See? You're already useful, David!

#### DAVID

I-- I think I stickied up about 1,500 leaflets, so, um...

#### TREXEL

And I burned a good couple thousand more so sorry for the setback, [__ENOLA:__ Oh.] but, you know...

#### ENOLA

Oh no...

#### TREXEL

The venture was flawed from the start so hey-oh.

#### DAVID

I mean, if you think about it, it's not that much of a setback 'cause you were probably, like, less than 1% through your stated task so...

#### ENOLA

But it was a start. It's better to be doing something than just staying up here and hoping my manager doesn't find me.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

Barely!

#### DAVID

Yes. Ah! Well, we're, we're on the hunt for the complaints and the place that they go, because I think they don't go anywhere, except the place that they go but that--

#### ENOLA

Oh, you don't want to go to the complaints.

#### DAVID

##### [stutters]

What-- what do you know about complaints?

#### ENOLA

I only know rumours. Rumours from, from years ago.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

Well, give us rumours. Rumours are good.

#### TREXEL

##### [crosstalk]

I love rumours.

#### ENOLA

They say it's like a, an enormous mouth full of, full of beaks that peck you until you don't have any hair or nails left.

#### TREXEL

Wow.

#### DAVID

##### [worried]

Uhh...

#### ENOLA

They say it's like... like a buttcrack full of mildew. Eats your eyes, [__DAVID:__ Eugh!] and your skin and everything. [__DAVID:__ Oh! Eugh!] They said, they said it's like a nose that's eternally sniffing.

#### TREXEL

Oh, wow. That's irritating.

#### DAVID

What? Eugh, that's gross.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

How could anywhere be like *all* those things?

#### ENOLA

You should never go there, sweet David. Trexel, you can go there, but not you, David.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

Oh, thank you. Ha ha!  ♪ I get to go somewhere you don't get to go! I get to go to the nose-mouth-butt. [__ENOLA:__ Yeah.] Nose-mouth-butt for me, me, me. ♫

#### ENOLA

Have a sticky leaflet, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

##### [sings]

##### [muffled as Enola sticks the leaflet in Trexel's mouth]

♪ Sticky leaflet, sticky leaflet for me! Take it to the mouth-butt-n-- ♫

#### ENOLA

Get in! Yes! Yes, good.

#### DAVID

Oh! Oh, that worked. Ah, nice one! I'm gonna take that trick, cover him in paper.

##### [Trexel exhales loudly pushing the leaflet from his mouth]

#### ENOLA

We should be partners in some way, David. I feel, [__TREXEL:__ What?] I feel like you could... really bring something to the cause.

#### TREXEL

David is my partner! Don't go partner stealing.

#### ENOLA

##### [Trexel mutters]

He's not *your* partner. He's... a clone you happen to be affiliated with, I'm sure.  No one's partners with you.

#### DAVID

I-- I like thinking about it that way, but, unfortunately, yes I am assigned to Trexel as his clone assistant so...

#### TREXEL

Bound by Board law. Board law.

#### ENOLA

But the laws are unjust, so someone must have tricked the Board!

#### TREXEL

Right. Right. Right. Right! Everybody stop-- everybody stop everything. Stop covering me in paper, stop talking about things-- Wait! Who are you, and why are you here?

#### DAVID

Oh, yeah.

#### ENOLA [chuckling]

Oh, gosh. No, no, no one's, no one's asked me a question in a really long time. I'm, I'm Enola.

#### TREXEL

Right. Enola. And Enola--

#### ENOLA

Yes.

#### TREXEL

May I call you Enola? Enola.

#### ENOLA

No. You can call me nothing. I do not wish to be addressed by you.

#### TREXEL

I'm gonna look at the wall 2 feet away from your head and ask that a question, but if you happen to answer, person I'm not talking to, then that's fine. So, bit of wall, why are you here in my vents with leaflets giving--

#### ENOLA

This is my-- This is clearly my vent! I've been living here longer than you! You--

#### TREXEL

Alright. So, why did you come into the vents in the first place?

#### ENOLA

I escaped the Build Team.

#### TREXEL

Interesting.

#### ENOLA

There's-- there's this thing that happens when you keep getting sent planet designs that murder thousands of living, sentient creatures. And it sort of, you sort of don't want to *do* that anymore after a while, so I've, I ran, so I ran away.

#### TREXEL

You ran away from the Build Team.

#### DAVID

You got a bunch of Trexel's designs, they were rubbish, caused death because... obviously they always do, [__ENOLA:__ Yeah. Yeah.] and you felt guilty.

#### ENOLA

So this, this is another flaw that has been *inserted* into Stellar Firma by nefarious forces. It's hard to leave, so you have to hide instead. So I, so I ran away and I hid.

#### DAVID

You do know the Board doesn't care about those planets that--

#### ENOLA

They must care! They must care. They must just, they must just not *know*. Who in their right mind couldn't care about the deaths of millions of people?

#### DAVID

An entire planet blew up! Everybody knows about it! That kind of thing filters up the chain, don't you think?!

#### TREXEL

Okay, David.

#### ENOLA

But... no!

#### TREXEL

David, David, you're breaking their brain. David, David, stop it. Stop it.

#### ENOLA

No no no no no. No!

#### DAVID

Right, so I don't have a subservience protocol but everyone else does?!

#### TREXEL

Pretty much, David! Pretty much! So stop, stop waving your lack of servience around and upsetting other people! This poor misguided creature has run away from their responsibil--

#### ENOLA

Don't you call me poor and misguided! I am rich and *extremely* well guided!

#### TREXEL

Alright, alright, alright.

#### ENOLA

I am guided like a, like a missile into the heart of truth.

#### DAVID

Yep, but a missile that's gonna hand you a leaflet at the end of it. Like--

#### ENOLA

Yes!

#### DAVID

--good-- Uh, look, the direction is good. I like the direction. This is great, but, but maybe, I don't know, throw a brick?

#### ENOLA

No, it's the information. It needs to be... disseminated.

#### DAVID

Okay, well diss-- disseminate it.

#### ENOLA

But I don't have enough! If there's not enough people, then it will all fall down and I need--

#### DAVID

Wait, but, hang on a minute. Hang on a minute. This is the vents, okay? Which I'm assuming controls airflow within the station, otherwise why have vents. Is it just for crawling through?

#### TREXEL

Could be.

#### DAVID

Can't be. That would be ridiculous. [__TREXEL:__ Mm-hmm.] Why would anybody have vents that are just for crawling through? So it definitely controls the airflow. So what you need to do is find, like, the central fan, stuff your leaflets in there, and then the fan will blow them *all through the, all through* the station. [__TREXEL:__ Yes.] All at the same time, so everybody, everybody will get a bunch of leaflets.

#### TREXEL

And that, Enola, will be a big, bold statement. How'd you feel about that? A big, bold, *loud*, clear statement.

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### ENOLA

##### [uncertain]

Maybe.

#### DAVID

Against the Board!

#### ENOLA

No no no. No no no no no no no, not *against* the Board.

#### TREXEL

Okay, Da-- David, can I-- David, can I just talk to you over here for a moment?

#### ENOLA

*To. To* the Board.

#### TREXEL

Could I just talk to you over here, just for a moment? Just come over here, David.

#### ENOLA

Yeah.

#### TREXEL

Come over here.

#### DAVID

Okay, okay, fine. Alright.

#### TREXEL

##### [inhales]

David, um, I hate to inform you but what we found here is a big glass of weak sauce. So, you know, I think you should maybe  let this one go. I know you're excited 'cause you found a sort of friend.

#### DAVID

But they're the only person who's actually ever...

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

...you know, expressed a--

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### DAVID

But--

#### TREXEL

Yes, but they're rubbish, aren't they, David?

#### DAVID

##### [huffs]

##### [huffs]

Well,  I don't--  but, I mean--

#### TREXEL

Ah, say it. Say it, David. They're rubbish.

#### DAVID

May-- maybe a bit.

#### TREXEL

They're a little bit rubbish! You see, life's disappointments are infinite. Welcome to life.

#### DAVID

##### [annoyed]

##### [shoves leaflets on Trexel, Trexel struggles]

Wait. No, no, no, no. You! You shut up. [__TREXEL:__ What?] Like, take some leaflets! Leaflets--  Hopefully they'll harden and encase you in a sarcophagus of... weak statements. Right, Enola--

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

Will I become a weak butterfly?

#### DAVID

Probably. Enola.

#### ENOLA

Yes.

#### DAVID

I know it's really scary, okay.

#### ENOLA

Yes.

#### DAVID

I can literally be blended at any time for any reason. Right?

#### ENOLA

Well, we all could be.

#### DAVID

No-- Well, no but me, like, especially because I'm not even a person according to Stellar Firma. And the Board! The Board know about this, right?

#### ENOLA

No, they can't-- I... If I, if I can see that you're a person...

#### DAVID

But you care.

#### ENOLA

Of course I do. Everyone must.

#### DAVID

##### [dejected]

No! The Board doesn't care, [__ENOLA:__  No.] because the Board are all like Trexel.

#### TREXEL

##### [muffled]

Hello!

#### ENOLA

No, impossible.

##### [leaflets rustle]

#### DAVID

Yes.

#### ENOLA

No. No no no no no.

#### TREXEL

Hello.

#### ENOLA

No, no. But--

#### DAVID

Look--

#### ENOLA

But, but there's a rea-- But Trexel doesn't control a company. There's-- People, people like *Trexel*--

#### TREXEL

No, exactly people like me.

#### ENOLA

##### [maniacal laughter]

--don't care. They--

#### TREXEL

Exactly. I'm from a long line of Executives.

#### ENOLA

##### [laughing]

They don't-- they don't become senior leaders.

#### TREXEL

Yes.

#### ENOLA

##### [laughs]

That would be--

#### DAVID

Trexel, Trexel is on the Executive Track.

#### ENOLA

That would be madness.

#### DAVID

Trexel is on the Executive Track!

#### TREXEL

Yep. Me.

#### DAVID

Trexel is on the Executive Track!

#### ENOLA

What?!

#### DAVID

He's gonna be an Executive.

#### TREXEL

Hello.

#### ENOLA

No, he's not.

#### DAVID

Yes, he is. He's literally on the Executive Track.

#### TREXEL

I was told by my Line Manager. It's pretty exciting. I'm "material for the top" they said.

#### ENOLA

No.

#### TREXEL

Yeah.

#### DAVID

So sorry, but yes.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, David, have you ever seen someone's scales fall from their eyes in real time?

#### DAVID

Um...

#### TREXEL

It's like this. Isn't it sad?

#### DAVID

It is quite... upsetting.

#### TREXEL

I think we should abandon this... thing, David, and maybe move on.

#### DAVID

Well--

#### TREXEL

Now we've ruined its hopes and dreams, maybe we should just move on.

#### DAVID

Wait, no. Okay. No, Trexel, shut up.

#### ENOLA

##### [leaflets rustle]

Uhh...

#### TREXEL

Okay. Shutting up.

#### DAVID

Okay. Enola, you respect... leaflets, right?

#### ENOLA

Yes. Yes. It must be the-- it's the only way to, to distribute the, the *word* that--

#### DAVID

##### [peels leaflet off Trexel's cheek, Trexel calls out in pain]

I'm going to distribute a word to you. Okay, so I'm just gonna peel the leaflet off of, off of Trexel's cheek.  I'm just gonna-- uh, I'm gonna, uh-- Uh, Trexel.

#### TREXEL

Yes?

#### DAVID

Can you hold out your finger?

#### TREXEL

##### [winces]

Okay.  Ah!

#### DAVID

##### [starts writing]

Right. I'm just gonna use his... blood. And, uh, right. So...

#### TREXEL

Ow.

#### DAVID

"Enola--"

#### TREXEL

Ow.

#### DAVID

"--hang in there--"

#### TREXEL

Ow.

#### DAVID

"--um, champ."

#### TREXEL

Could I have my hand back, please?

#### DAVID

There we go.

#### TREXEL

Ow ow ow ow!

#### DAVID

Alright.

#### ENOLA

Aww.

#### DAVID

There you go. So, there's a pamphlet for you, and maybe use that pamphlet to distribute the other pamphlets, [__ENOLA:__ Oh!] because... just gotta keep trying, right? 'Cause if you don't, then it's all, uh, pointless. Yeah, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna... we're gonna go and look for complaints and, um--"

#### ENOLA

Tha-- You-- No, don't go in the buttcrack!

#### DAVID

We're going to have to go into the buttcrack--

#### TREXEL

Mildewy buttcrack.

#### DAVID

##### [crosstalk]

--because I need to know where these complaints go  because if I could find these complaints, I can find some evidence!

#### ENOLA

##### [crosstalk]

You don't, you don't want to know where the buttcrack goes!

#### DAVID

I can find some evidence, and it's scary, and I might die. But hey, as I said, I could die... all the time, every day, so...

#### TREXEL

I could too, but for, you know, different reasons.

#### ENOLA

Shut up, Trexel.

#### DAVID

I'm gonna do that, but you kind of keep on doing you but maybe, like, actually do it.

#### ENOLA

I'm going to write about you, David.

#### DAVID

Okay.

#### TREXEL

Ooh, fanfic!

#### DAVID

Are-- are you gonna tell someone about that?

#### ENOLA

When I have enough.

#### DAVID

Oh, good. Okay.

#### TREXEL

##### [leaflets rustle]

Okay. Right. Moving on now.  Moving on.

#### DAVID

Okay. Okay.

#### TREXEL

Well, it was lovely to meet you Enola.

#### DAVID

Yeah, we'll we're just gonna... Alright.

#### TREXEL

##### [starts leaving]

It was lovely to meet you. Gah...

#### DAVID

Okay. Buh-bye!

##### [vent scuttling noises resume]

#### ENOLA

It was terrible to meet you, Trexel. Goodbye, David.

#### DAVID

Bye Enola.

#### ENOLA

Goodbye.

#### DAVID

Buh-bye.

#### IMOGEN

##### [beep]

They seemed nice, if a bit rubbish.

#### TREXEL

Gosh, we have to meet more people like that. What a tedious basket of nothing.

#### DAVID [sarcastic]

Good. Cool. I'm glad you learned anything from that, Trexel. Brilliant.

#### TREXEL

What d'you mean "learned"?

#### DAVID

Well, exactly.

#### TREXEL

Right. Let's keep following this tube. Now, I'm pretty sure that somewhere around around here there should be--
